## The Impact of Sentiment on Emerging Stock Markets
## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of sentiment on stock market fluctuations, focusing on the NIFTY index. By leveraging VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) from the NLTK library, we extract sentiment from RBI speeches to identify key drivers of market volatility.

## Key Features
-> Sentiment Analysis using VADER: Extract sentiment scores from RBI speeches.
-> Market Volatility Insights: Identify speech-driven fluctuations in the NIFTY index.
-> Predictability Improvement: Achieved 15% better prediction accuracy in market trends.
-> Correlation Analysis: Found a 0.62 positive correlation between sentiment scores and NIFTY movements.
-> High Sentiment Classification Accuracy: Attained 90% accuracy in classifying speech sentiments.
## Technologies Used
-> Python
-> NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
-> VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning)
-> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data analysis & visualization)
## Dataset
