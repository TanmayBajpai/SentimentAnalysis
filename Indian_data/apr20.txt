Union Budget 2018-19:
An Assessment*

1
Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit
and grants for creation of capital assets signifying that amount of capital
receipts that are being used for actual consumption expenditure of the
Government.

92
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)/Fiscal
Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) review
roadmap (Table 1). The achievement of the target
of 3.0 per cent of GDP has been deferred to 2020-21
as per the proposed new regime of the FRBM. The
Government has further decided to insert adequately
defined “escape and buoyancy clauses” to determine
when the targets may be relaxed or tightened as the
case may be2

. The Government has also decided to do
away with the deficit targets on revenue account, i.e.
RD and consequentially, ERD.
The decomposition of GFD for 2018-19 shows that
although the revenue deficit-GDP ratio is budgeted to

reduce in 2018-19 vis-à-vis 2017-18, it continues to pre-
empt almost 67 per cent of the borrowed resources as

against 59 per cent in 2016-17 (Table 2).
The fiscal slippage in 2017-18 needs to be seen
in the context of the reforms that are underway,
especially the GST and its implementation as well as
the fact that less than the full year’s collections were
available. Nevertheless, it might have implications
for macro-economic stability while undermining

the confidence of external investors (RBI, Sixth Bi-
monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018). The fiscal

credibility is particularly important from ratings
agencies’ perspective, considering that India remains
a relatively high debt and high deficit country among
similarly rated countries (Annex II). Also, given that
India’s combined deficit remains high vis-a-vis its
Asian peers, there is a need for radical programme of
deep fiscal adjustment requiring close coordination
between the Union and the State governments (Joshi,
2017) (Annex III).
While the headline fiscal deficit numbers
have been widely analysed vis-à-vis observable
parameters, assessing the fiscal deficit with respect
to certain unobservable parameters also provide
some useful insights. International institutions
like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) have conducted extensive
research in this area and are encouraging economies to
adopt and publish fiscal stance after due adjustments
for the impact on account of business cycle and other
unobserved cyclical factors like asset and commodity
prices (Bornhorst et al., 2011; Fedelino et al., 2009;
Girouard and Andre 2005). This is crucial, particularly
to enhance fiscal transparency as weakening of the
fiscal balance can sometimes be masked temporarily
by high output/asset price upturns. Conversely, during
a recession, the fiscal balance can be overstated on
account of cyclical factors.
In 2017-18, growth slowed cyclically and this
contributed to some loss of tax revenue. Computing
the cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit as per the IMF
definition3

, the business cycle impact on fiscal deficit

Union Budget 2018-19: An Assessment

is estimated to be about 0.17 per cent of GDP in
2017-18. This implies that but for the negative output
gap, the gross fiscal deficit would have been 3.3
per cent of GDP and not the headline 3.5 per cent.
However, this fiscal leeway gets wiped out if one takes
into account the terms of trade benefit that the fisc
had enjoyed due to decline in oil prices since 2015-
16 on dual grounds: lower subsidies on Kerosene and
LPG as well as higher excise on petrol and diesel as low

prices were not completely passed on to consumers.
While the benefit due to terms of trade effect is
estimated at its highest in 2016-17 at 0.62 per cent
of GDP, for 2017-18 it is placed at 0.48 per cent4
taking the overall fiscal balance adjusted for cyclical
and terms of trade effect to about 3.8 per cent (Chart
1). Going forward in 2018-19, with oil prices rising
and output gap remaining close/slightly below the
potential, fiscal deficit may not enjoy these terms of
trade and business cycle benefits as indicated in the
last row of Table 3.
II. Receipts
II.1 Tax Revenue
The Union Budget has estimated gross tax
revenue to grow by 16.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 12.1
per cent of GDP (Annex IV). Net of devolution of tax
revenues to States, net tax revenue is budgeted to
grow by 16.6 per cent to 7.9 per cent of GDP. This is
the highest budgeted tax-GDP ratio so far, reflecting
the formalisation of GST and widening of the tax base
(Chart 2).

4 Terms of trade effect have been estimated by (1) subtracting the excess
excise in petrol and diesel in these years from its long term trend and
(2) by adding the estimated additional subsidy that GoI would have given
based on the average long run elasticity of subsidies to oil price gap. While
the methodology remains as in the literature, it may be noted that terms of
trade benefit has generally been computed for oil exporting countries during
oil price rise (Parkyn, 2010 and Turner, 2006). However, given that India is
an importer of oil, terms of trade benefit is associated with oil price decline.

The budgeted buoyancies for all tax categories
of direct taxes are higher in 2018-19 than the
average of the preceding eight years (2010-11 to
2017-18) (Table 4).
II.1.1 Direct Taxes
Direct taxes are budgeted to grow by 14.4 per cent
in 2018-19, mainly on account of an estimated 19.9 per
cent growth in income tax collections. The number of
taxpayers has increased post demonetisation. During
the current financial year, 6.84 crore income-tax
returns were filed as compared to 5.43 crore returns
filed during the last financial year, which translates
into a growth rate of 26 per cent5

. Direct Taxes

collections during 2017-18 have helped in making up
for the shortfall in non-tax revenue.
The Government aiming to provide relief
to salaried taxpayers, has announced a standard
deduction of ` 40,000/- in lieu of the present exemption
in respect of transport allowance and reimbursement
of miscellaneous medical expenses. On the other
hand, the existing 3 per cent education cess will be
replaced by a 4 per cent “Health and Education Cess”
to be levied on the tax payable.
The corporate tax rate of 25 per cent for
companies whose turnover was less than ` 0.5 billion
in financial year 2015-16 has now been extended

to companies with turnover up to ` 2.5 billion. The
estimate of revenue forgone due to this measure is
`70 billion during the financial year 2018-19. The
lower corporate income tax rate for 99 per cent of the
companies, however, will benefit the entire class of
micro, small and medium enterprises as it will leave
them with higher investible surpluses. Also, it will
encourage higher tax compliance in the MSME sector.
II.1.2 Indirect Taxes
Indirect taxes collection in 2017-18 exceeded
2016-17 collections by 8.7 per cent, despite receiving
GST revenues only for 11 months, instead of 12
months. Indirect taxes are budgeted to grow by 19.1 per
cent during 2018-19, with GST collections budgeted at
`7.4 trillion - an increase of 67.3 per cent and 21.5 per
cent after adjusting for loss of one month collection
(Table 5). On GST, while on one hand concerns have
been raised on the significantly high budgeted numbers
given that rationalisation of rates is still underway, on
the other hand, international evidence suggests that
implementation of VAT/ GST have resulted in a higher
government revenue-GDP ratio over time (RBI, 2017).
About 1.03 crore taxpayers have been registered under
GST so far (till February 25, 2018) of which 16.42 lakh
are Composition Dealers which are required to file
returns every quarter6
.

Customs duty on certain items have been
increased – illustratively, the duty on mobile phones
has been increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent
and on certain parts of TVs to 15 per cent. Though the
increase in customs duty is expected to incentivise

the domestic value addition and the Make in India
initiative and may also promote creation of more jobs
in the country, it may likely be seen as a protectionist
measure attracting retaliatory actions from trading
partners.
II.2 Non-Tax Revenue
Receipts from non-tax revenues are budgeted
to increase in 2018-19 by 3.9 per cent. Dividend and
profits from public sector enterprises (including
public sector banks) and surplus transfer from the
RBI were lower than the budgeted amount by 25.3 per
cent during 2017-18 and are effectively budgeted to
increase on the lower base (Table 6). With the merger
of the Railway Budget with the Union Budget, the
Railways has stopped paying dividend on the capital
at charge since 2017-18.
Within receipts from economic services, net
receipts from communication services (i.e., spectrum
auctions) are budgeted to be significantly higher
in 2018-19 than in 2017-18 (RE) - by 58.3 per cent.
Notably, net receipts from communication services
were budgeted at `443.4 billion in 2017-18, but actual
receipts (`307.4 billion) fell short mainly because of
deferment of spectrum auctions.
It is observed that non tax revenues provided
strong support to central government receipts in
2015-16 (27.0 per cent growth) and 2016-17 (33.2 per
cent growth). With non-tax revenues in 2017-18 and
2018-19 being lower than 2016-17, the pressure will be
higher on the government to achieve the tax revenue
and the disinvestment targets.

II.3 Non-debt Capital Receipts
The target for disinvestment has been pegged
at `800 billion in 2018-19 (BE). In 2017-18 (RE), the
Government exceeded the target by `275 billion
facilitated by buoyant stock markets (Chart 3). Net
recoveries of loans and advances are budgeted to

decline by 30.2 per cent over 2017-18 (RE). Total non-
debt capital receipts, which were `330 billion higher

in 2017-18 (RE) than BE, are estimated to decline by
21.5 per cent in 2018-19 (BE). With the realisation
of budgeted targets for disinvestment in 2017-18 for
the first time since 2009-10, there is optimism on
the prospects for 2018-19. This will support revenue
mobilisation efforts and render the deficit financeable.
Any corrections in the stock market may, however,
make it challenging for the Government to meet its
budgeted target in 2018-19.
III. Expenditure
Total expenditure is budgeted to grow by 10.1 per
cent in 2018-19 (12.3 per cent in 2017-18 RE) (Table 7).
Revenue expenditure is budgeted to grow at a higher
rate than capital expenditure.

The Budget estimates for different expenditure
categories deviate from the MTEF Statement (an FRBM
document), which was laid before the Parliament in
August 2017. Total expenditure is budgeted to be
4.4 per cent higher than in the MTEF statement,
mainly on account of higher revenue expenditure,
particularly pensions and petroleum subsidies
(Table 8). Expenditure projections diverging in the
span of five months, i.e., from the MTEF in August
2017 may pose risks to credibility of the fiscal
policy stance. With the revenue-capital ratio
slated to worsen from 6:1 in 2016-17 to 7:1 in
2018-19, the quality of public expenditure may
remain a concern.

Union Budget 2018-19: An Assessment

III.1 Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure which is growth inducing
has been proposed to be raised by 9.9 per cent in 2018-
19 over the revised estimates of 2017-18, marking
a decline of 3.0 per cent when compared with BE
of 2017-18. Capital Outlay (capital expenditure
excluding loans and advances) is budgeted to
increase by 12.6 per cent in 2018-19, a marginal
rise over BE but sharply higher than 1.6 per cent in
2017-18 (RE). Capital outlay on major infrastructure
is estimated to grow by a robust 23.0 per cent in
2018-19 (BE) - as against a decline of (-) 2.1 per cent in
2017-18 (RE) - led by the railways, roads and bridges

(Table 9). Expenditure on civil aviation, on the
other hand, is in contraction, as it has been since
2016-17, the sector is being encouraged to tap the
market through borrowings and asset monetisation
rather than rely on budgetary support. The budgeted
allocation for communications (growth of 0.5 per cent
over 2017-18 RE) may not seem to be in consonance
with the objective of gradual transformation towards
a digital economy.
In a partial equilibrium framework, a rise of
` 207 billion in capital outlay is likely to increase
output by ` 434 billion (about 0.2 % of GDP in
2018-19), assuming the capital outlay multiplier to
be 2.10 (Jain and Kumar; 2013). It may be noted that
amongst its peer EMEs, India’s share of GDP spent on
capital expenditure is low despite relatively higher
fiscal deficit (Chart 4) (Akin et al; 2017). Actual capital
expenditure, however, would be higher than the
budget estimates if the internal and extra budgetary
resources (IEBR) deployed by the central Public
Sector Units (PSUs) and commercial departmental
undertakings are considered. It, therefore, needs to
be recognised that the Government is now financing
important expenditure of capital nature through
extra budgetary resources (EBR).

education, together, is budgeted to grow by 4.6
per cent as per the Union Budget 2018-19. In

constituting health and education in India continues
to remain woefully below peers (Chart 5).

RBI Bulletin April 2018 99
Union Budget 2018-19: An Assessment

III.2 Subsidies and Interest Payments
Subsidies and interest payments constitute a
major portion of government’s committed revenue
expenditure. In contrast to 2017-18 (RE) when major
subsidies declined by `106.2 billion from the budget
estimates in a broad-based manner, they are slated
to increase by 15.1 per cent in 2018-19 mainly on
account of increase in food subsidies by 20.7 per cent.
The share of major subsidies is, however, budgeted to
remain unchanged at 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2018-19
(BE) (Table 10).
Given the likely hardening of global crude and gas
prices, petroleum and fertiliser subsidies, however,
may rise. Owing to the farmer distress, minimum
support prices have also risen reflecting itself in slight
increase in food subsidy. Going forward, the budgetary
outgo on major subsidies, however, should fall in
the medium term via targeting and better coverage,
through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme and
digitisation, which could reduce leakages.
Interest payments are budgeted to increase
by 8.5 per cent in 2018-19 over 2017-18 (RE). In
2018-19 (BE), interest payments have been estimated
at `5758 billion constituting 26.9 per cent of budgeted
revenue expenditure and 23.6 per cent of the total
budgeted expenditure of the central government,
respectively. They are budgeted to be around 3.1 per
cent of GDP in 2018-19 marginally lower than 3.2 per
cent in 2017-18 (RE). The buoyancy in revenues are

expected to mitigate the interest payment outgo of the
Government8
.
Annex V presents the key receipts, expenditure
and deficit indicators at a glance.
IV. Financing of Deficit
Gross market borrowing for 2018-19 is estimated
at `6,055 billion, higher by about 1.1 per cent over
the preceding year’s level. Net market borrowing at
`3,991 billion is, however, estimated to decline by 2.6
per cent during the same period on account of higher
repayments during the year (Table 11). Switches
(gross) of securities (which is cash neutral) and net
buyback of `281 billion and `719 billion, respectively,
are also provided for9

. Net market borrowing through
dated securities accounting for 63.9 per cent of the
GFD in 2018-19 (BE) is lower than 68.9 per cent in
2017-18 (RE). The Union Budget has provided for
gross issuance of cash management bills (CMBs) at
`1 trillion for cash management operations and not
for funding the GFD. The net issuances of CMB is nil
for 2018-19 (BE). Government aims to raise `50 billion
via Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2018-19. Going
forward, fiscal slippage concerns and concomitant
higher borrowing requirements may have implications
for the economy wide cost of borrowing and could
crowd out productive private sector investment
(RBI, MPR, 2018). Also, the potential interest savings
due to reduced reliance on the market may not

It may be noted that subsequent to budget announcement, the GoI, in its press release dated March 26 2018 has announced a reduction in financing via
market borrowing by `500 billion, with `250 billion each to be financed by buybacks and National Small Savings Fund (NSSF).

V. Liabilities
Total liabilities-GDP ratio of the Central
Government is budgeted to decline to 47.8 per cent in
2018-19 from 49.1 per cent in 2017-18 (RE). Notably, the
Government has accepted the key recommendation
of the Fiscal Reform and Budget Management
Committee, 2017 relating to adoption of the Debt Rule
and has decided to bring down Central Government’s
Debt to GDP ratio to 40 per cent by 2024-25. Interest
payments as proportion of revenue receipts, which is
an indicator of debt servicing capacity, is budgeted to
decrease marginally from the previous year (Chart 6).
VI. Resource Transfers from Centre to States in
2018-19
Following the recommendation of the 14th Finance
Commission, the States’ share of tax devolution was
increased from 32 to 42 per cent of the divisible
pool, serving the twin objectives of increasing the
flow of unconditional transfers to the States and
yet leaving appropriate fiscal space for the Union
to carry out specific-purpose transfers to the States.

Union Budget 2018-19: An Assessment

Given the above background, gross transfer to state
governments is expected to increase marginally during
2018-19, largely driven by tax devolution and ‘finance
commission grants’, even as growth in transfer through
different schemes has decelerated sharply. Centre is
expected to transfer `7,881 billion in the form of tax
devolution to the state governments in 2018-19, which
is around 17.0 per cent higher than the transfer made
a year ago. This sharp increase is expected assuming a
buoyant tax collection in 2018-19.
In the Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, it is
highlighted that state governments seem to be moving
close to their targeted fiscal consolidation – in part
because the centre has guaranteed them a large increase
in their indirect tax take, as part of the GST agreement.
The transfer of GST compensation cess to states is
fiscal neutral as the above amounts have been levied

as a cess over the peak rate of 28 per cent on certain
specified luxury and demerit goods, like tobacco and
tobacco products, pan masala, aerated waters, motor
vehicles. This is proposed to be introduced for a period
of five years to compensate States for any revenue loss
on account of implementation of GST. The amounts
are transferred to a non-lapsable fund in the public
account called the GST Compensation Fund as per the
Section 10 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act,
2017.
Growth in transfer under centrally sponsored
schemes, which has a share of around 22.0 per cent in
the gross transfer, is expected to decelerate sharply by
5.3 percent in 2018-19 as against a growth of 16.8 per
cent a year ago. The transfer to states (per cent to GDP)
is expected to increase by 10 basis points in 2018-19 in
both gross and net terms (Table 12).

VII. Other Important Measures with relevance to
Reserve Bank of India
VII.1 Bank Recapitalisation
The bank recapitalisation program has been
launched with bonds of `800 billion being issued
this year. The programme has been integrated with
an ambitious reform agenda, under the rubric of
an Enhanced Access and Service Excellence (EASE)
programme. This recapitalisation will pave the way
for the public sector banks to lend additional credit
of `5 trillion. Recapitalisation is a significant step
by the Government in strengthening the balance
sheet of banks and should enable banks to scale up
credit to productive sectors. Although the bond-based
recapitalisation is budget-neutral, it effectively results
in increasing the Government’s shareholding in public
sector banks through rights shares and this might be
perceived as roll-back of reforms by investors.
VII.2 Standing Deposit Facility
The Finance Bill proposes an amendment to
section 17 of the RBI Act to enable the introduction
of the standing deposit facility (SDF). This will
considerably strengthen the conduct of monetary
policy as it will provide the RBI the wherewithal to
absorb exceptionally large expansion of liquidity
without having to provide collateral to market
participants. This additional instrument in the toolkit
of the RBI will address episodes such as demonetisation
and surges of capital inflows, and may even obviate
the need for issuances under the Market Stabilisation
Scheme which carry fiscal costs.
VII.3 Minimum Support Prices
Minimum support prices (MSP) for rabi crops
at least at one and a half times of the cost has been
extended to all kharif crops with a view to ensuring
remunerative prices for farmers. It may be noted that

Rabi MSPs fixed for crop year 2017-18 (market year
2018-19) were one and a half times of A2+FL costs,
not overall C2 costs which also include the imputed
costs of owned land and interest on owned fixed
capital. Further, for all crops (kharif and rabi) taken
together, CPI-weighted MSPs were more than 1.5
times A2+FL costs, but only 14 per cent higher over
C2 costs9
. In addition, there are several proposals that
could reduce volatility in food inflation, viz.; higher
procurement will stabilise market prices around
MSPs; inclusion of tomatoes, onions and potatoes
under ‘Operation Greens’; and adoption of cluster
based models in a scientific manner at district levels.
Although the exact impact of MSP increase on inflation
cannot be fully assessed at this stage but it does pose
upside risks to inflation outlook (RBI, Sixth Bi-monthly
Monetary Policy Statement, 2018).
VIII. Overall Assessment
Summing up, the Union Budget for 2018-19
is confronted with a tight trade-off between the
rigours of fiscal consolidation and the demands for
stimulating the economy. While the waning of the
drag from demonetisation and GST implementation
will have favourable effects on economic activity and
boost tax revenues, terms of trade losses associated
with the hardening of international crude prices could
restrict fiscal space. Meanwhile, sizeable outlays on
agriculture and infrastructure will impose pressure

on revenues, necessitating adherence or even over-
achievement of disinvestment targets that are in

some sense autonomous to the decision to divest and
contingent upon market conditions.
Turning to revenues, GST collections could
benefit from delayed buoyancy as the system stabilises

A2 + FL includes all expenses in cash and kind on account of hired labour
including human, bullock, machine, seed, insecticides, pesticides, manure,
fertilizers, irrigation charges and miscellaneous expenses and imputed costs
of family labour (FL). C2 includes A2+FL costs as well as imputed costs of
owned land and interest on owned fixed capital.

Union Budget 2018-19: An Assessment

and this could encourage further reforms in the form
of moving towards a simpler and more equitable
rate structure. The increase in customs duties on
selected items is essentially a revenue raising effort.
On direct taxes, while the proposal to extend the
rate of 25 per cent to companies with turnover up to
`2.5 billion will entail revenue losses, the benefit to
MSMEs from the supportive tax regime could increase
buoyancy and compliance. The surge in the number
of tax assesses, especially new ones, augurs well for
raising the tax-GDP ratio to at least the levels of peers.
Against this background, achieving the disinvestment
target assumes crucial importance and will warrant
a strategic approach that takes advantage of market
conditions and investor appetite.
As regards the interaction of the Budget with
the financial system, recapitalisation of banks could
lend tailwinds to the recent recovery in bank credit
and, in turn, support overall growth. The introduction
of the Standing Deposit Facility is a big positive for
macroeconomic and financial stability.
Finally, the emphasis on the rural economy
is welcome and it is a step forward in the vision
of doubling farm incomes by 2022 set out by the
Government. This would revive rural demand and set
the stage for a durable upturn in growth. The push
towards digitisation, delivery of Aadhar enabled public
services and the focus on employment will make the
revival of growth inclusive and equitable.
