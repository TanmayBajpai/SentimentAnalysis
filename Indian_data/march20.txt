banks, housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-
banking financial corporations (NBFCs).

Indian households are generally net savers
and suppliers of financial resources for the rest
of the economy. However, net financial assets2
of the households turned negative (-7.3 per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP)) in the third
quarter of 2016-17, reflecting the transitory effects of
demonetisation3

. With subsequent remonetisation,
the household sector’s net financial assets

turned around and in the fourth quarter they amounted
to 14.8 per cent of GDP. In 2017-18, net financial assets
of households are estimated at 8.3 per cent of GDP in
Q2, up from 5.8 per cent of GDP in Q1 (Table 1).
The quarterly rate of net financial assets displays a high
degree of volatility revealing the shifts in preferences
of households for the various instruments on both the
assets and liabilities side, which usually does not get
captured in the annual data (Chart 1).

III. Instruments of Households Financial Assets
and Liabilities
Outstanding financial assets4

of households in
select instruments, namely, currency, bank deposits,
life insurance funds, mutual funds, pension and
provident funds display some interesting trend

(Annex II: Table 3). Deposits with banks have remained
the major form of financial assets, with the share of
outstanding deposits with commercial banks being the
highest, followed by insurance funds and currency, at
the end of Q2: 2017-18 (Chart 2).
Aggregate deposits with banks and non-banks
increased in Q2:2016-17 to 8.6 per cent of GDP
from 8.1 per cent in the previous quarter, possibly
reflecting the impact of the release of the 7th Central
Pay Commission (CPC) award of salaries and pensions
as well as mobilisation of deposits under the income
declaration scheme.
Instrument-wise analysis of assets indicates
that there was a major shift in the asset classes of the
households in the wake of demonetisation. Currency
with households contracted sharply in Q3:2016-
17 (Chart 3). The contraction in currency was not
matched by a proportionate increase in deposits

due to (i) the redemption of Foreign Currency Non-
Resident (Bank) (FCNR(B)) deposits; (ii) repayment

of loans with specified bank notes (SBN); and

4 Due to unavailability of data the outstanding data has been provided only for select assets.

(iii) repayment of outstanding bills (electricity,
property tax, telephone bills) with SBNs5
.

In Q4:2016-17, currency holdings spurted
following remonetisation, going up to 11.1 per cent
of quarterly GDP from (-) 21.5 per cent in Q3:2016-17,
while aggregate deposits went down to 3.6 per cent in
Q4:2016-17 from 5.4 per cent in Q3:2016-17.
In the first two quarters of 2017-18, assets in
the form of currency continued to move towards its
normal levels. While, currency with the public rose to
1.0 per cent of GDP in Q2:2017-18, aggregate deposits
was 5.9 per cent of GDP. Pension funds and mutual
funds picked up in 2017-18 and their shares in GDP
were 0.6 per cent and 1.4 per cent in the second
quarter, respectively.
In liabilities side, the largest component in the
household sector’s financial liabilities is generally
loans and borrowings from commercial banks (Annex
II: Table 3). At the end of Q2:2017-18, the share of
outstanding loans from commercial banks remained
the highest, followed by the HFCs, NBFCs, cooperative
banks and credit societies, in that order (Chart 4).

Borrowings of households from the corporate sector
and general government remained negligible.
Liabilities in the form of borrowings from banks
turned negative post-demonetisation as demonetised
currency was used to pay back loans (Chart 5). Post
remonetisation, borrowings from banks recovered
to 6.3 per cent of GDP in Q4:2016-17 from a low

of (-) 4.8 per cent of GDP in Q3:2016-17. The flow
of gross financial liabilities increased to 5.3 per cent in
Q2:2017-18 from 1.5 per cent in Q1: 2017-18 .
IV. Conclusion
The quarterly estimates of households’
financial assets and liabilities for the period Q1:2015-
16 to Q2:2017-18, using flow of funds approach and
based on information available in financial
statements of counterparty sectors, show some
interesting observations which are not visible in
the annual data. Instrument-wise analysis of assets
indicates that there was a shift in households’
financial assets portfolio in Q3:2016-17 post
demonetisation. The assets holdings of households

reverted to normal levels in subsequent quarters. At
outstanding level, households’ financial assets are
mainly in form of bank deposits with commercial
banks as the largest suppliers of credit. Furthermore,
pension funds and investment funds picked up in
Q2:2017-18.
