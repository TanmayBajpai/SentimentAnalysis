positions and transactions through financial
instruments on a ‘from-whom-to-whom’ (FWTW)
basis. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been
compiling and publishing the flow of funds (FoF)
accounts for the Indian economy since 19641
. The
FSF account traces the interaction between the real
and the financial sectors and the level of financial
development in the economy. It also provides
insights into sources and uses of financial funds and
movements of sectoral financial balances.
The FSF account covers five institutional sectors,
in line with the UN’s System of National Accounts
2008 (SNA 2008): (i) financial corporations (FC):
(ii) non-financial corporations (NFCs), public and private;
(iii) general government (GG); (iv) households and
non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH)2
;
and (v) the rest of the world (RoW) (Exhibit 1).
The overall financial resource balance of the economy
moderated during 2018-19 as net borrowings of nonfinancial corporations increased and household savings
slowed. The balance sheet of other depository corporations
contracted as households shifted from deposits to other
competing financial instruments. The financial net
worth of general government and public non-financial
corporations went deeper into negative territory. India
remained a net borrower from the rest of the world.

The first report covered the data for the period 1951-52 to 1993-94. Prior to the release of “Financial Stocks and Flows of the Indian Economy 2011-
12 to 2017-18” (published on July 2019), the article was titled as ‘Flow of Funds Account of India’, as only financial flows were published.
2 Households also include non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) such as religious societies, social, cultural, recreational sports clubs,
political parties, trade unions, etc. These institutions are clubbed with the household sector due to their low economic importance and paucity of information.

Financial Stocks and Flows of the Indian Economy: 2016-17 to 2018-19
Transactions between these sectors are classified
under nine financial instruments, viz., (i) currency;
(ii) deposits; (iii) debt securities; (iv) loans and
borrowings; (v) equity; (vi) investment funds (such as
mutual funds); (vii) insurance, pension and provident
funds; (viii) monetary gold; and (ix) other accounts
(including trade debt) and other liabilities/assets not
elsewhere classified (NEC).
The article is organised into six sections. Section II
presents the international experience on compilation
of financial accounts. A brief account of the sectoral
financial resource gaps is given in Section III for the
period 2016-17 to 2018-19, with preliminary estimates
for 2019-20. Section IV discusses the sectoral mapping
of the financial flows, with instrument-wise financial
flows in Section V. Section VI concludes with some
policy perspectives.
II. International Experience
In the aftermath of global financial crisis, the
G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors
(FMCBG) endorsed the G20 Data Gaps Initiative
(DGI) in October 2009, and its second phase in 2015.
This included the recommendation ‘to compile and
disseminate, on a quarterly and annual frequency,
sectoral accounts flows and balance sheet data, based
on the internationally agreed template, including
data for the other (non-bank) financial corporations
sector, and develop from-whom-to-whom matrices for
both transactions and stocks to support balance sheet
analysis’ (IMF, 2016). Data availability on a FWTW
basis varies across countries in terms of frequency
and time lags (Table 1).
Among EMEs, for instance, Turkey adheres to
the SNA 2008 in both instrument-wise as well as
sector-wise classification in both consolidated and
unconsolidated formats. China does not publish
financial stocks, only instrument-wise classification of
the final sources and uses of each sector are presented.
Countries ranging from Belgium, Canada, New
Zealand, Switzerland and the UK to Colombia, Brazil
and Indonesia reported complete absence of FWTW
information, while France and the United States
have annual and quarterly FWTW information only
for some instruments. As per the survey conducted
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) for G-20 countries and its key
accession partners regarding availability of sectoral
data, 13 European countries and one non-European
country, i.e., Australia, had FWTW data in respect of
all the major eight instruments at quarterly as well as
at annual frequencies.
III. Sectoral Financial Resource Gaps
In India, balance sheet data required for the
compilation of FSF account are released with varying
lags3
 by various sectors of the economy. The sectorwise financial resource position indicates that
households (HHs), financial corporations and private
non-financial corporations (PvNFCs) had positive
financial net worth, while general government
and public non-financial corporations (PuNFCs)
had negative financial net worth during the period

2011-12 to 2019-20 (Table 2). Also, financial net worth
has been deteriorating for both GG and PuNFCs during
the period, while for PvNFCs, it stabilised after
worsening during 2018-19. The financial net worth of
households has however, improved during 2019-20,
as per preliminary estimates.
In terms of net flow of resources, non-financial
corporations and general government are the major
deficit sectors, while financial corporations and
households (HHs) are the major surplus sectors. The
overall financial resource balance of the economy -
measured as net acquisition of financial assets less
net incurrence of liabilities - moderated during 2018-
19 primarily due to increase in net borrowings of nonfinancial corporations and moderation in household
saving (Table 3). The marginal surplus in the overall
financial resource balance in 2018-19 turned into a
deficit in 2019-20 on account of the widening resource
deficits of general government and public nonfinancial corporations.
IV. Sectoral Financial Balances and Trajectories4
Analysis of financial assets and liabilities of each
sector, which are mapped to other sectors, provides
some interesting insights on the Indian economy.

Financial Stocks and Flows of the Indian Economy: 2016-17 to 2018-19
IV.1 Financial Corporations
Among the financial corporations, other
depository corporations (ODCs)5
 constitute 52 per cent
of total assets, followed by other financial corporations
(OFCs)6
 (38 per cent) and the central bank (10 per
cent), the latter is kept separate from ODCs, in view
of the responsibility for monetary policy and financial
stability. Among depository institutions, scheduled
commercial banks had the preponderant share of 44
per cent, highlighting the bank-based nature of the
Indian economy. Within OFCs, insurance had the
highest share of 11 per cent in total assets of the FC
sector, followed by non-deposit taking non-banking
financial companies (NBFC-ND) (7 per cent), mutual
funds (6 per cent) and provident and pension funds
(5 per cent) (Chart 1).
IV.1.1 Central Bank
The balance sheet7
 size of the Reserve Bank
declined moderately as a percent to GDP in 2018-19. It
has, however, expanded significantly during 2019-20
owing to various measures taken by the Reserve Bank
to augment system-level liquidity (Chart 2).
The main liability of the Reserve Bank is currency
in circulation, with around 95 per cent held by
the household sector. The increase in currency in
2018-19 was much lower than in 2017-18 - the year of
remonetisation, and processing and reconciliation of
specified banknotes (SBNs).
The second most important central bank liability
is deposits, which are mostly assets of banks
maintained as balances in their current accounts
to meet cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirements and
payment and settlement obligations (RBI, 2019a).
Overall deposits of banks with the Reserve Bank
declined in absolute terms for the second year in
succession in 2018-19. While bankers’ deposits with
the Reserve Bank increased due to higher deposit
mobilisation, this was more than offset by the decline
in deposits under reverse repo.
On the assets side, the predominant instrument
is debt securities issued by the rest of the world
(RoW) and the Central Government. The Reserve
Bank’s domestic investments increased by 45.4 per
cent during 2018-19, on account of net purchase
of government securities as part of its liquidity
management operations. Loans to the other depository
corporations by the Reserve Bank decreased sharply
in 2018-19 from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower
use of liquidity facility under repo/term repo/marginal

equity). Since liabilities here also include shareholders’ equity, financial resource balance will not be equal to the difference between the net worth of two
consecutive years.

banks and credit societies, local area banks, non-banking financial companies

mutual funds (MF), provident and pension funds, non-deposit taking nonbanking financial companies (NBFCs-ND), All India Financial Institutions

Corporations (SFCs) and non-deposit taking housing finance companies

standing facility (MSF) against government securities

IV.1.2 Other Depository Corporations (ODC)
Other depository corporations, despite being
the dominant sector, have experienced a declining
balance sheet since 2013-14, reflecting a shift in
the preferences away from deposits towards other
competing financial instruments such as mutual
funds and insurance (Chart 3). Within the ODC sector,

complementarity in their financial intermediation
roles. The consolidated balance sheet of NBFCs has
been buoyed by strong credit expansion, aided by
low NPA levels relative to banks and stronger capital
buffers during 2016-17 and 2017-18 (RBI, 2019b).
However, credit outflow from the NBFC-D moderated
during 2018-19, owing to liquidity crisis triggered by
Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited
(IL&FS) crisis and subsequent rating downgrade faced
by the NBFCs sector.
Liabilities of Other Deposit Corporations (ODCs)
Household deposits are the most important
instruments on the liabilities side, followed by loans
from OFCs (Chart 4). The secular deceleration in deposit
mobilisation which set in since 2009-10, barring the
year of demonetisation, was arrested in 2018-19 due
to stiff competition among banks for raising resources
including through higher deposit rates. With higher
deposit mobilisation, the borrowings of the ODCs
sector declined (RBI, 2019b). The ODCs’ liability
towards the rest of the world (RoW) contracted during
2018-19 in the wake of global economic slowdown and
reversal of capital flows towards advanced economies.
Assets of Other Deposit Corporations (ODCs)
On the assets side, loans and advances to
households and non-financial corporations remain the
most important instrument, followed by investment
in government securities (Chart 5). Disbursement
of loans and advances, which had picked up in
2017-18 continued to maintain momentum in
2018-19. This was aided by improvement in the credit
environment caused by near complete recognition
of non-performing assets (NPAs), recapitalisation of
public sector banks (PSBs) and the ongoing resolution
process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
(IBC) (RBI, 2019b).
Overall financial net worth of this sector
improved marginally in 2018-19 after a gap of seven
years, mainly on account of improvement in the asset
quality of SCBs.
IV.1.3 Other Financial Corporations (OFC)
In India, the balance sheet size of other financial
corporation (OFC) sector constituted 38 per cent
of total assets of FCs. It continued to expand in

2018-19, reflecting changing preference for financial
instruments, as discussed in the previous section
(Chart 6).
Post IL&FC crisis, raising resources through
debentures became costlier and as investor confidence
waned for non-deposit taking non-banking financial
companies (NBFC-NDs), they had to take recourse to

bank borrowing (RBI, 2019b). This was reflected in
higher financial claims on OFCs from other depository
corporations during 2018-19 (Chart 7).
The assets side of their balance sheet is
dominated by government debt securities, followed
by loans issued to Public Non-Financial Corporations
and deposits with the ODC sector (Chart 8).
Bifurcation of financial flows into transactions
and valuation changes8
 reveals that, on an average, 26
per cent of the change in assets of OFCs sector during
the period 2016-17 to 2018-19 was due to appreciation
of its assets (Statement 3.1).
IV.2 Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs)
Non-financial Corporations, with a share of around
17 per cent of the total financial assets of the economy
and comprising of Public Non-Financial Corporations
and Private Non-Financial Corporations, contribute
to growth of the economy through investment in
productive assets. The financial net worth of the NFCs

continued to decline in 2018-19 on account of a sharp
fall in the financial assets of Private Non-Financial
Corporations (Table 2). The persisting negative net
worth of Public Non-Financial Corporations reflects
the dismal performance of ailing Central Public Sector
Units (CPSUs).
Among non-financial corporations, private units
prefer equity finance (44 per cent of resources), while
public units favour loans and borrowings as external
finance. Equity flows to PvNFCs had turned negative
during 2017-18 due to share buyback by many firms
in order to avoid the dividend distribution tax. In
2018-19, they resumed largely on account of conversion

of outstanding loans into equity for stressed power
sector enterprises such as GMR Chhattisgarh and
Resurgent Power Ventures (Chart 9).
The resource gap of private corporations widened
to 2.2 per cent in 2018-19 from 0.2 per cent in 2017-18,
as flows in the form of loans and borrowings recorded
an uptick (Chart 10). In case of the public corporations
too, the resource gap increased in 2018-19 (Chart 11).
IV.3 General Government9
In India, both the central government and the state
governments run deficits and are net borrowers in the
economy. Liabilities of general government remained
at an elevated level in 2018-19, which were dominated
by debt securities constituting around 83 per cent of
total liabilities in 2018-19 - two-thirds of which was
subscribed by ODCs and OFCs (Statement 3.1 and
Chart 12).
On the assets side, equity holding in PSUs has the
largest share, followed by deposits with ODCs. On an
average, around 82 per cent of general government
assets are held in the form of equity. Assets in the
form of deposits with ODCs are more pronounced in
the case of state governments, which had accumulated
large cash balances, reflecting poor cash management.
IV.4 Households and NPISHs
Households are typically net savers and net lenders
and enjoy positive financial net worth. The net financial
surplus of the household sector declined to 8.2 per cent

of net national income (NNI) in 2018-19 from 8.7 per
cent in the previous year10, due to a larger moderation
in acquisition of financial assets than in liabilities
(Chart 13).
Loans and borrowings from banks and other
financial institutions are the primary constituent
of households liabilities, while household assets
are held mostly in the form of deposits, insurance
and currency. Outstanding loans and borrowings
by households exhibit a secular rise in recent years,
gradually increasing from 32.0 per cent of GDP in
2016-17 to 33.8 per cent of GDP in 2018-19. This is

in contrast to declining overall credit growth over the
same period as SCBs preferred retails loans over large
industrial loans due to lower NPAs in the former (RBI,
2019b).
On the asset side, deposits constitute nearly
half of households’ assets, with its share in total
assets remaining stable. Currency holding, which
had fluctuated significantly during 2016-17 and
2017-18 due to demonetisation and subsequent remonetisation, returned to the pre-demonetisation
level during 2018-19. There has been sustained
increase in acquisition of insurance, pension funds
and investment in debt securities.
IV.5 Rest of the World
India is a net borrower from the rest of the world
(RoW), with its net borrowings rising over time. The
main source of funds for the RoW is through issuance
of debt securities, primarily subscribed by central
bank and private corporates (Chart 14).
On the other hand, most of the asset of RoW
are in the form of foreign direct investment and
portfolio investment in equities and debt securities,
lending to Indian corporates and deposits held by

non-resident Indians (Chart 15). Flows under equity
and debt instruments shrank during 2018-19 owing
to large sell-off triggered by tighter monetary policy in
the United States, and shadow of slowdown looming
large. Loans and borrowings by Indian companies
rose to a five-year high in 2018-19 reflecting higher
interest rate in the domestic market, and increased
risk aversion among domestic lenders inflicted by
high non-performing assets. Net borrowing from
RoW as proportion of GDP, however, narrowed down
for four successive years. Overall, net borrowing from
the rest of the world as a proportion to GDP declined
during 2019-20. Other major trends included strong
equity flows, decline in trade credit and advances
and an uptick in the Reserve Bank’s subscription to
debt securities issued abroad.
V. Financial Flows by Instruments
Loans and borrowing have the highest share of
29.0 per cent in total financial transactions, followed
by debt securities and deposits with a share of 20.9 and
18.0 per cent, respectively. Loans and borrowings are
largely disbursed by ODCs (67 per cent) and are largely
held as liability in the balance sheet of households
and PvNFCs.

Some shifts have been observed in the use of
instruments in financial transactions. Share of deposits
is on decline despite some uptick during 2018-19.
Around 99 per cent of deposits are liabilities of ODCs,
62 per cent of which are held by the households. The
share of currency, which improved in 2017-18 due to
remonetisation, waned in 2018-19.
Debt securities – the second most important
instrument in financial liabilities – declined
significantly during 2018-19, owing to lower issuance
of debt securities by general government and RoW.
Debt securities are mostly subscribed by OFCs (42 per
cent), followed by Central Bank and ODCs. The use
of equity – which had declined during 2017-18 owing

can play a pivotal role in making the financial climate
more conducive to borrowers and lenders, and
thereby encourage investment.
In case of non-financial corporations, the resource
gap of both private and public entities widened in
2018-19 on account of larger borrowings. In 2019-
20, while the private corporate sector is expected to
lower its resource gap owing to reduction in capital
formation, the public sector deficit is likely to increase.
NFC’s balance sheet had been over-leveraged even
before the onset of the pandemic. A combination
of policies including subsidised credit, additional
credit lines to cater to working capital needs, and tax
concessions to revive capex and generate adequate
cash-flow and profit could prove crucial in mitigating
stress in the corporate sector’s balance sheet. Revival
of balance sheets of public non-financial corporations
needs special attention. The government deficit is
slated to increase further mainly due to a decline in
gross revenue under corporation tax, reflecting midyear cut in tax rates. Decline in net financial surplus
of households in 2018-19 had adverse implications for
the rest of the sectors in terms of reduced availability
of finances. Household financial savings appear to
have improved in 2019-20 mainly due to increase
in bank deposits and sharper decline in loans and
borrowings by households, whereas their investment
in insurance and mutual funds remained at the same
level as in the previous year.
to share buyback by corporate sector – bounced back
during 2018-19. The share of mutual funds, which
has been increasing over the years, declined during
2018-19, owing to volatility in the financial market
(Table 4).
VI. Conclusion
The overall financial resource balance of the
economy, though in marginal surplus, deteriorated
during 2018-19 and with the protracted economic
slowdown during 2019-20, the resource balance of the
overall economy is expected to worsen further. This
would imply higher overseas financial flows unless the
financial surpluses of households and non-financial
corporations improve and the deficit of government
sector reduces.
Potential growth of the economy will depend
to a large extent on the strength of funding from
the financial corporations. Financial net worth of
the other depository corporations showed some
improvement in 2018-19 backed by declining
NPAs. Going forward, the credit flow from banking
sector needs to improve in order to help revive the
manufacturing sector and private investment in the
economy. At the same time, continued strengthening
of NBFC sector, post the liquidity crisis triggered
by IL&FS default in September 2018, should gain
momentum, which will ensure extension of liquidity
to the financial periphery. The financial corporations

On the road to recovery from the catastrophic
economic impact of the pandemic, ensuring seamless
flow of resources among all sectors will remain
pivotal. Bank deposits are likely to see a spike due
to increase in precautionary savings of households
while lower investment demand is likely to moderate
offtake of credit resulting in widening of resource
gap of the other depository corporations. The role
of financial intermediaries, therefore, is going to be
vital in ensuring delivery of credit to sectors severely
affected by the pandemic. Looking further ahead in
2020-21, the COVID-19 pandemic is also expected
to induce behavioural changes such as, increase in
internet-based transactions vis-à-vis cash and cardbased transactions.
