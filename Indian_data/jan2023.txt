2020 turned out to be a year in which everything 
changed. The year 2021 has commenced with countries 
across the world in a massive vaccination drive. In 
India, recent shifts in the macroeconomic landscape have 
brightened the outlook, with GDP in striking distance 
of attaining positive territory and inflation easing closer 
to the target. Financial markets remain ebullient with 
EMEs receiving strong portfolio inflows and India on 
track for receiving record annual inflows of foreign 
direct investment.
What a year 2020 turned out to be! It began like 
any other, just a day longer than 2019, with what 
looked like pneumonia reported to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) from a distant wet market in 
Wuhan, China. By the end of the year, COVID-19 had 
officially infected 81 million people, and possibly 500 
million more were never diagnosed (The Economist, 
December 19, 2020). It caused 1.8 million recorded 
deaths, but many hundreds of thousands have gone 
unrecorded. The two world wars and the Spanish flu 
caused far more deaths, but COVID-19 has altered 
people’s daily lives in ways that these events did 
not. Millions of survivors still struggle with the scars 
and exhaustion left by the virus, and the world is 
witnessing an unparalleled scale of suffering, poverty 
(according to the UN, over 200 million people will be 
thrust into extreme poverty), inequality and danger. 
Children have lost education, graduates placements, 
labour has endured forced migration, and people of all 
ages have faced loneliness.
Unemployment has soared and so have stock 
markets. Foreign investors have rushed into emerging 
markets – while US$ 90 billion left emerging market 
economies (EMEs) in March alone, portfolio flows 
have staged a return since then which accelerated 
to US$ 83.4 billion in the month of November and 
in December, US$ 16.6 billion has poured into 
debt and US$ 29.3 billion into equities (IIF, 2021) 
(Chart 1). Among EMEs, China and India pulled flows 
on account of growth prospects.

As the optimism in projections sobers, world 
output could be at least 7 per cent lower than without 
COVID-19 (The Economist, January 9, 2021) – the 
biggest slump since the second world war, world 
merchandise trade by 9.2 per cent (WTO, 2020) and 
world trade in services by 15 per cent (UNCTAD, 2020). 
History shows that social unrest surges 14 months 
after a pandemic and peaks at 24 months (IMF, 2020). 
The clear blue skies during lockdowns revealed that 
within the fast-moving COVID-19 crisis is a slowmoving climate crisis, impervious to populist denial, 
global in its disruptive capacity and far costlier. 
Yet, impossibly, it appears that the world is 
rounding the corner on this once-in-a-century year 
that changed everything. As 2021 arrived, more than 
12 million people had received their first doses of the 
vaccine (Chart 2). Newspapers have reported that 8.25 
billion doses of vaccines have been secured by various 
countries through advance contracts (COVID-19 
vaccines are two-dose regimens).
On January 3, 2021 India formally approved the 
emergency use of two vaccines and on January 16, 
it launched the world’s biggest vaccination drives, 
with plans to inoculate about 300 million people on 
a priority list this year. It is reported that India has 
secured 1.2 billion advance doses, covering 85 per cent 
of the population (Bloomberg, 2020). 
Four other features set India apart from the 
rest of the world, increasing the probability that 
our recovery may overtake most projections, as this 
article has consistently maintained. The 27-indicator 
economic activity index (EAI) (Kumar, 2020) has 
updated its nowcast for Q3:2020-21 and estimates the 
quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.1 per cent, as expected 
in the December 2020 issue. This is also reflected in 
the first advance estimates of national income for 
2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office 
(NSO) on January 7 in which real GDP growth in 
2020-21 is estimated at (-) 7.7 per cent as against (-) 10.3 
per cent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
in October 2020 and (-) 7.5 per cent by the monetary 
policy committee (MPC) in December 2020 (Chart 3).

September, India has ‘bent it like Beckham’ – by the 
end of 2020, the number of active cases had fallen to 
2,54,254 from a peak of 10,17,754 on September 17. 
The recovery rate in India has improved to 96.1 per 
cent, the second highest in the world. The mortality 
rate is 1.4 per cent, lower than the world death rate 
(2.2 per cent), and the second lowest among countries 
with over a million infections (Chart 4). 
Second, after a hiatus of four months during 
which total expenditure of the central government 
went into contraction or remained muted, it rejoined 
the celebration of the recovery in November 2020, 
surging by 48.3 per cent on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis. 
Within this expenditure push, growth-nurturing 
capital expenditure shrugged off a three-month 
contraction and expanded by 248.5 per cent, close to 
half of which is due to increase in transfers to states for 
capex in line with Aatma Nirbhar 2.0 announcements 
(Chart 5). At the sub-national level, information for 
20 states show that the growth in capital expenditure 
turned positive during October 2020 after contracting 
consecutively for 8 months. These are significant 
developments from the point of view of the economy 
gaining a stronger foothold, because government 
final consumption expenditure (GFCE) has provided 
valuable counter-cyclical support to GDP continuously 
from Q4:2016-17. Without this support, real GDP 
growth of 7.0 per cent in 2017-18 would have been 
only 6.5 per cent, while it would have been 5.7 per 
cent instead of 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and 3.3 per 
cent instead of 4.2 per cent in Q1:2019-20 (Chart 6). 
In Q1:2020-21 when the full brunt of COVID-19 took 
real GDP down by an unprecedented 23.9 per cent,

GFCE prevented an even more precipitous fall of 29.3 
per cent.
Third, merchandise imports finally emerged out 
of contraction over 9 consecutive months and grew 
by 7.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December 2020 (Chart 7). 
The rebound in imports was broad-based, with as 
many as 20 out of 30 major commodities registering 
expansion. Many of these items are of the nature of 
intermediate goods in supply chains, which augurs 
well for domestic industrial activity and importintensive exports. This suggests that moribund 
absorptive capacity of the economy is coming back 
to life, rekindled by domestic demand. Surges of 
capital inflows, which the Indian economy is enjoying 
currently as a preferred destination, may from hereon, 
support investment and growth and even crowd-in 
domestic saving instead of passively flowing back 
uphill through reserve accumulations. The days of the 
tail wagging the dog1
 of India’s balance of payments 
may finally be drawing to a close.
Fourth, bank credit demand has increased at a 
pace above 6 per cent, reversing a 5-month stretch of 
sub-6 per cent growth. On top of robust credit flow 
to agriculture, micro and small enterprises and the 
services sector led by transport, trade and tourism 
have powered the turning around of the credit cycle. 
Set against this backdrop, the remainder of 
the article is structured into five Sections. Section 
II captures in a nutshell the rapidly evolving 
developments in the global economy. The underlying 
impulses in the domestic economy are distilled in 
Section III. Section IV evaluates financial conditions, 
while the last Section puts out some perspectives.
II. The Global Setting
It was a lockdown Christmas for a swathe 
of advanced economies (AEs) as a new and more 
virulent strain of the virus and the rapid spread 
of the second/ third wave dampened not just the 
season’s cheer but also the optimism generated by 
the vaccine. Disruptions from the pandemic in a 
few EMEs have turned out to be more severe than 
previously anticipated, with the brunt being faced by 
commodity exporters. Overall, following the initial 
rebound since mid-2020, the global economy recovery

 For a developing economy like India, it is the merchandise trade account 
that dominates its Balance of Payments, and the capital account usually 
plays a smaller financing role. In recent years, however, especially since 
2019, net capital flows to India have risen to a level at which they play a 
predominant role in Balance of Payments, resulting in the phenomenon of 
the ‘tail wagging the dog’. For further reading, please refer to https://www.

has slowed. The improvement in manufacturing 
activity and trade has been marred by depressed 
services sectors. The fall in global investment has 
been pronounced. While financial conditions remain 
ultra-easy, financial fragilities are mounting, leading 
to fears that the COVID-19 crisis would eventually 
morph into a financial crisis (Reinhart, 2020). 
With January, the season of projection updates 
has arrived, and the World Bank has led off. In its 
latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) released on 
January 5, 2021, the global economy is estimated to 
have contracted by 4.3 per cent in 2020 – AEs by 5.4 
per cent; EMEs ex-China by 5.0 per cent (Table 1). 
In 2021, global output is forecast to expand by 4 per 
cent but remain 5.3 per cent below pre-pandemic 
projections, or by about US$ 4.7 trillion. AEs and 
EMEs ex-China will roughly look alike in growth 
profiles, eking out modest expansions of 3.3-3.4 per 
cent. India is expected to expand by 5.4 per cent, a 
pale shadow of its historical record. It is estimated 
that COVID-19 will cause a loss of US$ 10.3 trillion 
in world GDP in 2020 and 2021 (Chart 8). Among the 
developing economies, India will suffer the biggest 
loss of US$ 950 billion (The Economist, January 9, 
2021). The pandemic may exacerbate risks around 
the accumulation of debt on the one hand and a 
prolonged slowdown in potential output on the 
other. Consequently, downside risks to projections 
predominate the horizon. 
On the price situation, economies are struggling 
to meet inflation targets, AEs from below and several 
EMEs from above (Table 2). Food prices have registered 
a surge, particularly in EMEs, owing to a confluence 
of factors working in conjunction, viz., governments 
shoring up their food reserves, logistical hassles, and 
La Nina adversely affecting crop production in Latin 
America2
. The Food and Agriculture Organization’s 
food price index rose by 3.1 per cent in 2020, with the 
monthly index at a six-year high in December.

Meanwhile, crude oil prices continued to rise 
in December and the first half of January on the 
back of positive developments on the vaccine front 
and extension of production cuts by organization 
of the petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) plus. 
At an average of US$ 49.9 per barrel in December, 
Brent was 15.5 per cent dearer in December (Chart 9). 
The average Brent price in 2020, however, was about 
34 per cent lower than in 2019. The World Bank 
estimates oil demand to have declined by a historic 
9 per cent in 2020.
Gold wrapped up a phenomenal year, which 
saw bullion prices scaling an all-time high in August, 
with gains of 25.1 per cent, following up the 18.3 per 
cent ascent in the previous year. Safe haven demand 
and unprecedented monetary accommodation made 
bullion a top-performing asset in 2020. Gold prices 
have corrected in 2021 so far with sell-offs due to 
waning safe haven demand as also due to the dollar 
gaining strength (Chart 10). Basking in gold’s glory, 
silver had a good year too in 2020. Base metals,

which had seen a sharp dip in the initial months of 
the year, recovered strongly in H2:2020, and ended 
the year in gains.
The global composite purchasing managers’ 
index (PMI) moderated to 52.7 in December, mainly 
on account of the services PMI sliding to a five-month 
low of 51.8. The good news is that it has remained 
in expansion zone for the whole of H2:2020. The 
global manufacturing PMI in December maintained 
the 33-month high level of November. Industrial 
output has risen continuously in H2:2020 after the 
severe decline observed between February and June 
(Chart 11). Meanwhile, price momentum continues to 
build incipiently - input prices rose in December at 
their highest pace since May 2011.
The volume of world merchandise trade showed 
sequential improvement of 11.6 per cent in Q3:2020 
after a contraction of 12.7 per cent in the previous 
quarter, according to the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). There was, however, a contraction of 5.6 per 
cent in Q3 on a y-o-y basis (Chart 12). This effectively 
means that the volume of merchandise trade during 
the first three quarters of 2020 was 8.2 per cent lower 
than in the corresponding period of the previous 
year, though still favourable vis-à-vis the WTO’s 
estimate of a 9.2 per cent contraction in world trade 
in 2020 as a whole. The World Bank estimates that 
world trade volume (goods and non-factor services) 
declined by 9.5 per cent in 2020 and the level 
of trade uncertainty remains higher than trend, 
notwithstanding recent developments such as the 
African Continental Free Trade Area agreement and 
the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
The improving macroeconomic outlook and rapid 
vaccination led equity markets to build on the record 
gains registered in November 2020, also benefitting 
from the Brexit deal and the US stimulus towards 
end-December. Despite the rising tide of valuations, 
stock markets in the UK, EU, Indonesia, Thailand and 
Chile, ended the year in the red. On the other hand, 
surging gains in stock markets of EMEs pulled in 
strong portfolio flows. The total portfolio flows into 
EMEs in December were US$ 45.9 billion, and for the 
year as a whole, they amounted to US$ 313.6 billion 
(IIF, 2021). Reflation trade and risk-on sentiments 
caused bond yields in the AEs to move up. On the 
other hand, bond yields in EMEs continued to ease,

reflecting the strong portfolio flows (Chart 13). The 
upbeat outlook engendered by the COVID-19 vaccine 
kept the US dollar on a downward slide in December 
and currencies of AEs and EMEs rallied to multi-year 
highs. Overall, the dollar index weakened by 2.1 per
cent in December, ending the year 2020 lower by 6.7

per cent. As a corollary, the Morgan Stanley Capital 
International Emerging Markets (MSCI-EM) index 
appreciated by 1.6 per cent in December and by 3.3 
per cent over the year as a whole. In 2021 so far, 
however, the dollar has strengthened, mostly against 
AE currencies such as the euro.
On the monetary policy front, amidst the 
general tendency among central banks of staying on 
hold on interest rates while engendering abundant 
liquidity conditions, there was a further expansion of 
monetary stimulus by the European Central Bank and 
the Bank of Japan in December. The Federal Reserve 
gave forward guidance of continuing asset purchases 
till it made progress on maximum employment and 
price stability goals. On the contrary, the central bank 
of Turkey effected a third policy rate hike in four 
months, battling high and surging inflation (Chart 14).
As the global economy steps into the new year, the 
near-term outlook remains clouded by a considerable 
amount of uncertainty as AEs struggle with virulent 
outbreaks of infections and stricter lockdowns, and 
EMEs stare at poverty levels last seen in 2017.
III. Domestic Developments
Implicit in the January 7 GDP release is what 
this article has been anticipating – barring the 
visitation of another wave, the worst is behind us 
(Chart 15). Recent high frequency indicators suggest 
that the recovery is getting stronger in its traction

and soon the winter of our discontent will be made 
glorious summer3
. Cross-country comparison indicates 
that India is on the move, ahead of other economies 
(Chart 16). The six largest states – Maharashtra, Tamil 
Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and West 
Bengal – recorded 87 per cent of normal footfalls in 
public places, the best levels so far in the pandemic 
(Mint tracker). Domestic trading activity as reflected 
in issuance of E-way bills expanded at a brisk pace, 
even over a high base, posting a growth of 15.9 per 
cent y-o-y – intra-state by 17.3 per cent and inter-state 
by 13.8 per cent. In fact, the number of E-way bills 
issued during December 2020 was the highest, 
suggesting that the recovery is no longer aloft on 
the fleeting tailwinds of festival spending but is rising 
Phoenix-like on the wings of an intrinsic momentum 
(Chart 17).
Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand conditions have either 
consolidated recent gains or vaulted up on 
strengthening pace in December 2020. Electricity 
consumption expanded at 5.0 per cent y-o-y, 
maintaining its growth for the fourth successive 
month (Chart 18). Northern and central states such 
as Madhya Pradesh (15 per cent), Rajasthan (12 per 
cent), Bihar (14 per cent), Punjab (12 per cent) and 
Uttar Pradesh (10 per cent) experienced a surge in 
power demand in December due to increased heating 
load. Mercury levels plunged to multi-year lows 
as an unusually intense winter took hold with La

Nina cooling the waters of the Pacific and a cold 
wave gripped most of upper India, interspersed 
with sporadic unseasonal showers in these states 
(Chart 19).
Domestic spending is normalising rapidly, and 
in sync, collections under the goods and services tax 
(GST) surged to an all time high of `1.15 lakh crore in 
December, breaking out of the `1 lakh crore ‘barrier’ 
for the third month in succession, and higher by 11.6 
per cent over a year ago (Chart 20). Business activity 
is regenerating in an ‘unlock’ mood, incentivised in 
substantial measure by a simplified return filing system.
Consumer confidence is regaining its groove. The 
Refinitiv-Ipsos consumer sentiment index inched up 
by 2.1 percentage points in December. Improvement 
was recorded on employment conditions, personal

finance, investment climate and confidence in the 
outlook for the economy. This is corroborated by Dun 
and Bradstreet’s report that consumer confidence 
will improve from January 2021, peak in July and 
continue till September ahead of the next festival 
season. Purchasing behaviour is expected to reveal 
a preference online and offline towards health 
and well-being products, ahead of a bigger shift to 
value added goods and essentials via digital and 
omni-channel sales. Alliances between e-commerce 
players and kirana stores are expected to expand 
to increase service delivery to meet rising demand. 
Upbeat consumer sentiment is also expressing itself 
in housing. There are signs of the housing sector 
turning around, with a sharp uptick in Q3:2020-21 
in sales of residential units - almost double the level 
of the preceding quarter - supported by favourable 
interest rates, still restrained housing prices, steep 
discounts by developers to clear inventory, and 
reduction in stamp duty by a few states (Chart 21). 
The revival in consumer spending is also evident in 
India’s fast- moving consumer goods (FMCG) market, 
which expanded by 17.0 per cent4
. 
Labour market conditions are also improving 
pari passu, with a gradual pick up in employment 
across space and time, as indicated by the household 
survey of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy 
(CMIE). The labour force participation rate recovered 
to 40.06 in December from a low of 35.57 in April 2020 
(Chart 22). With gradual lifting of inter-state movement 
restrictions, labour force participation rates across

states have picked up to around pre-pandemic levels 
with the exception of Delhi, Gujarat, Telangana and 
Tripura. Some states like Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya 
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have notched up swifter 
recoveries, with labour force participation rates 
recorded in December rising higher than those seen 
in the pre-lockdown period (Chart 23). Under the 
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act 
(MGNREGA), around 26.5 million households sought 
employment in December – 16.5 per cent higher than 
in the preceding month and over 55.5 per cent a year 
ago. By the close of December, 130 per cent of the 
budgeted amount was spent. 
It is likely that the employment situation 
would brighten even more in the coming months. 
According to staffing solutions provider TeamLease, 
hiring by information technology (IT) firms across 
various skill sets is likely to increase by 10-12 
per cent in 2021.
As mentioned earlier, a heartening development 
that improves the prospects of recovery is the 
vigorous resumption of government spending. The 
growth-giving role of government final consumption 
expenditure is invaluable at a time when all other 
components of GDP are in deep retrenchment under 
the metastasis purveyed by the pandemic. It is 
difficult to fully appreciate the importance of this 
development for the near-term outlook without a 
close understanding of the underlying dynamics that 
were etched out for the first time this year in 
the December 2020 issue of the Bulletin in an article 
titled ‘Government Finances 2020-21: A Half Yearly 
Review’ (RBI, 2020) which, incidentally, fulfils India’s 
compliance with the Special Data Dissemination 
Standard (SDDS) of the IMF.
The November 2020 edition of this article 
vivisected and laid out the ‘system’ in the stimulus 
given by the centre. Earlier, the Reserve Bank’s 
report on State Finances (RBI, 2020) showed how 
the states assumed the mantle of frontline warriors 
in the defence against the pandemic with several 
setbacks but also with some shining successes that 
caught the attention of the world. Underneath this 
logged chronicle, the reality is that the pandemic has 
inflicted a ’scissor effect’ on government finances. 
On the one hand, it stretched expenditure on 
account of the fiscal support to the economy that 
was completely unanticipated at the time of drawing 
up budgets for 2020-21. On the other, there was 
contraction in revenues as activity in the economy 
went into catatonic withdrawal with lockdowns and 
other containment measures. As a result, the general 
government gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 14.5 
per cent in H1:2020-21, with Q1 recording a spike to 
22.0 per cent that necessitated consolidation in Q2 
in the form of rationalisation and reprioritisation of 
expenditure (Chart 24). Going forward, two positive 
features are going to shape up the fiscal landscape 
in H2. First, the general government GFD-GDP ratio 
is likely to moderate to 10.4 per cent (within a 50 
per cent confidence band of 9.7-10.9 per cent). This 
development will be revenue-driven as the war effort 
of H2 bears fruit and receipts return to positive 
territory. Second, the quality of the fiscal deficit is 
also likely to be better in H2 as a substantial part of

investment-oriented stimulus under Aatma Nirbhar
2.0 and 3.0 (announced in October and November 
2020, respectively) is expected to fructify in this 
period. This is already evident in the November 2020 
monthly data on capex; however, both centre and 
states must resist resorting to large scale expenditure 
cuts to allay fiscal concerns. 
Turning to external demand, India’s merchandise 
exports have reached pre-COVID-19 levels and 
exhibited a growth of 0.1 per cent in December 2020. 
Non-oil exports actually expanded by 5.6 per cent, 
marking the fourth consecutive month of positive 
growth.
More noteworthy was the pickup in merchandise 
imports, which have rebounded by 7.6 per cent in 
December 2020 after a protracted nine months of 
contraction. The revival was led by gold, electronic 
goods and vegetable oils. Rising imports of pearls and 
precious stones, machinery, electronic goods and 
textiles reflect the revival of domestic activity as 
they are of the nature of intermediate goods in supply 
chains. This also augurs well for exports going forward. 
Even in the case of oil imports, moderation was seen 
in the rate of contraction, with oil imports declining 
by only 10.6 per cent in December as against a sharp 
contraction of 43.4 per cent in November. With 
robust growth in imports, the trade deficit scaled to a 
seventeen- month high at US$ 15.4 billion in December 
(Chart 25).
The faster revival seen in non-oil exports can be 
attributed to shipments of drugs and pharmaceuticals, 
agricultural items and iron ore, all of which have 
displayed resilience in the face of the pandemic and 
the massive contraction in world trade. As vaccination 
gathers pace across the globe, Indian pharma firms 
will exploit the edge they have in terms of the 
largest capacity globally in vaccine manufacturing
- India is already manufacturing 60 per cent of the 
vaccines sold globally. Furthermore, the production 
linked incentive (PLI) scheme introduced for bulk 
drugs and medical devices has received a positive 
response and is expected to support pharmaceutical
and medical exports going forward, while reducing 
India’s vulnerability to supply shocks in respect of 
raw materials and intermediates.

The extension of benefits under the Scheme for 
Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products 
(RoDTEP) to all export goods with effect from January
1, 2021 is expected to scale up the competitiveness of 
India’s exports5
. The risks to India’s export prospects 
stem from the shortage of container supplies caused 
by supply chain disruptions across the globe, reduced 
capacity of shipping lines, empty containers getting 
stranded at ports during lockdowns, reduction in 
port manpower limiting the speed of cargo handling, 
and consequent congestion in the ports. For Indian 
exports in particular, the situation was aggravated by 
the huge congestion at Colombo port, which acts 
as the transhipment hub for Indian cargo. The result 
has been that a sizeable chunk of cargo traffic from 
Colombo has been diverted to Kochi port. This has led 
to a surge in freight costs as also reflected in the rising 
Global Container Freight Index during NovemberDecember 2020 (Chart 26).
India’s current account remained in surplus for 
the third consecutive quarter in July-September
2020 (2.4 per cent of GDP), although it moderated in 
tandem with the resumption of domestic demand 
(Chart 27). While the coexistence of surpluses in 
the current and capital accounts of the balance of 
payments strengthens the buffer provided by foreign 
exchange reserves, India continues to contend with 
sluggish absorptive capacity. The silver lining is that 
the current account surplus has started to shrink in 
Q2 and may moderate further in H2:2020-21.
Aggregate Supply
Aggregate supply conditions strengthened 
through December 2020 on the back of resilience 
in agriculture and revival in manufacturing activity. 
Services sector activity too seems to be turning around, 
though contact-intensive services remain subdued 
and below pre-COVID levels.
Agriculture remains unscathed by the 
pandemic. Sowing of major crops has exceeded 
the normal acreage levels. Rabi sowing covered 
an area of 651.9 lakh hectare by January 15, 2021,
1.6 per cent higher than in the preceding year, 
and surpassing the full season normal acreage

full capacity as on January 14 as against the decennial 
average of 56 per cent; this is an important force 
multiplier for the rabi season (Chart 28). Wheat – 
the primary rabi staple – has recorded an increase in 
sowing acreage (2.0 per cent), mainly due to higher 
sowing in major producer states, notably Haryana 
(1.2 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (12.7 per cent). 
Pulses and oilseeds have also registered an impressive 
turnaround in acreage. With record kharif production, 
procurement of kharif rice at 51.3 million tonnes was
26.2 per cent higher than a year ago, taking the cereals 
(rice and wheat) buffer stock to 3.7 times the norm by 
January 1, 2021.
Although industrial output remains volatile, 
contracting by 1.9 per cent in November 2020 
after a record expansion in October by 4.2 per 
cent, industrial activity is finally turning around. 
The headline purchasing managers’ index (PMI) 
manufacturing expanded in December 2020 to
56.4, a tick higher than November’s reading of 56.3 
(Chart 29). Both new orders and output continued 
to grow strongly. The future output index expanded 
to 60.3 on hopes of improved market conditions, 
though confidence was stymied by worries on 
inflationary pressures. With gradual revival in 
industrial activity, Coal India Limited (CIL) recorded 
a 6.3 per cent growth in coal production in Q3. With 
regard to sales of passenger car vehicles, most of the 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) clocked 
double digit growth in December, ending the year 
on a bright note, as they restocked their exhausted 
inventories. Early data from the Ministry of Road 
and Transport reveal that over 1.8 million vehicles

were registered across India in December 2020, 
the highest ever since April - a growth of 10.3 per 
cent for the first time in the pandemic period. The 
quickening of activity was mainly driven in the nontransport vehicles segment. Sales of mini-trucks, 
pick-up vans and other light commercial vehicles are 
showing an uptick as more Indians turn to online 
shopping, increasing the need for last-mile delivery 
logistics.
In the services sector, a silent improvement is 
underway. The services PMI for December at 52.3 
expanded for the third consecutive month, driven 
by an increase in new domestic work intakes. Steel 
consumption – a proximate indicator for construction 
activity - also registered an expansion for the third 
consecutive month, recording 5.7 per cent y-o-y 
growth. Transportation services through railways 
continue to exhibit strong momentum, both in terms 
of loading and earnings. Freight traffic grew at 8.7 per 
cent in December, extending an acceleration phase 
that began in August to the fifth successive month 
(Chart 30). The uptick was broad-based across all 
categories of commodities, with the exception of coal.
Exuberant expansion also continued to characterise 
port cargo, which registered growth for the second 
consecutive month in December after eight successive 
months of contraction. With growing preference 
for personal mobility to avoid contact, passenger 
vehicle sales registered an acceleration for the fifth 
consecutive month in December.
Inflation
CPI inflation in December 2020 eased sharply to
4.6 per cent from 6.9 per cent in the last month. This 
was primarily on account of a substantial correction 
in food inflation - by 5 percentage points - to 3.9 
per cent in December from 8.9 per cent in November 
(Chart 31). Vegetables and cereals drove the sharp 
disinflation in food inflation. Prices of onions and 
potatoes, which had seen a substantial increase in 
the recent months, registered a sharp fall in December.
There was also a broad-based seasonal decline in 
prices of other vegetables. Along with a favourable 
base effect, these developments pushed vegetable 
prices into double digit deflation in December. Early 
indications of price movements of key food items 
for January (January 1-13, 2021), based on the 
high frequency food price data from the Ministry 
of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution 
(Department of Consumer Affairs), point to further

moderation in prices of vegetables. However, price 
pressures in respect of edible oils have continued in 
January so far (Chart 32).
The Indian basket of crude oil prices edged up 
to US$ 53 per barrel in January so far (January 
1-13, 2021) from US$ 50 a barrel in December. This has 
resulted in further increases in domestic pump prices 
in January so far. Along with it, the non-reversal of 
the steep increase in domestic excise duties and state 
taxes is pushing up pump prices to historically high

in corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures 
issued by the entities in specific sectors over and above the outstanding 
level of their investments in such instruments as on September 30, 2020.

loans and advances to these sectors.

CPI excluding food and fuel remained elevated 
at 5.5 per cent in December, even while exhibiting 
a small moderation from the November reading of
5.7 per cent, primarily due to telephone charges, 
education expenses and some softening in gold 
prices. Prices in respect of personal care and effects 
and also pan, tobacco and intoxicants continued to 
exhibit double-digit inflation in December. In spite 
of some softening, transport and communications 
inflation remained elevated in December due to 
motor vehicles prices, petroleum product prices and 
transportation fares.
CPI food inflation is seeing considerable softening 
primarily due to sharp corrections in vegetables 
prices. In near months, prices of eggs and poultry, 
meat and fish could also ease on account of a likely 
collapse in demand for poultry products due to 
sharp rise in the incidence of bird flu infections in 
January. On the other hand, price pressures in respect 
of CPI core components are likely to remain. PMIs 
for manufacturing and services sectors point to an 
intensification of input price pressures in December. 
This is coming from an increase in fuel costs, 
industrial metal prices, edible oil prices and increased 
cost of doing business in the post-lockdown situation. 
In a scenario where demand conditions are getting 
normalised and firms are regaining pricing power, this 
poses the risk of higher pass-through of rising inputs 
costs to output prices.
IV. Financial Conditions
The Reserve Bank has been ensuring through its 
market operations that congenial financial conditions 
prevail to nurture the recovery in the form of easy 
monetary and credit conditions. Through December
2020, the average daily net absorptions under the 
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) surged to `5,90,822 
crore, notwithstanding an advance tax flow out of 
the banking system in the second half of the month. 
The surplus liquidity was mopped up through
overnight reverse repos under the LAF, which rose to 
`7,37,314 crore as on December 31, 2020. In order to 
enable banks to exploit the synergies between central 
bank liquidity under on tap targeted long-term repo 
operations (TLTRO) scheme6
 and the Emergency 
Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 2.0 (ECLGS 2.0) of the 
Central Government, the Reserve Bank expanded the 
scope of the on tap TLTRO on December 4, 2020 to all 
stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee 
in addition to five sectors announced under the 
scheme on October 21, 2020. Banks can avail funds 
from the Reserve Bank under the on tap TLTRO and 
seek guarantee under ECLGS 2.0 to provide credit 
support to stressed sectors (Chart 33).
During the month, an outright open market 
operation (OMO) in State Development Loans (SDLs) 
was conducted on December 23, 2020 amounting 
to `10,000 crore, taking the total number of OMOs 
in SDLs to three starting from October 22, 2020. Two 
special OMOs (operation twist) were also conducted 
on December 17 and 30 to rein in term premia.

Market Segments

Money market rates edged up briefly on account 
of advance tax outflows, moving closer to the reverse 
repo rate from sub-LAF levels characterising the whole 
spectrum since mid of October 2020. The spread of 
the collateralised tri-party repo rate and market repo 
rate vis-à-vis the weighted average call rate (WACR) 
narrowed from (-) 32 basis points (bps) and (-) 29 bps 
in November to (-) 7 bps each in December 2020. Even 
rates on certificates of deposit (CDs), 91-day treasury 
bills and on commercial paper (CP) moved closer to 
overnight rates, although they continued to trade 
below the reverse repo rate (Chart 34).
Spreads in the other segments of financial market 
have narrowed considerably, mirroring the salutary 
impact of liquidity measures, regulatory relaxations 
and forward guidance. Corporate bond yields softened 
across the rating spectrum with yield on 1-year, 3-year 
and 5-year AAA-rated bonds declining by 205 bps,
184 bps and 122 bps, respectively, through May 22 
and December 31, 2020 (Chart 35). Even the yield on 
3-year BBB- (BBB minus)-rated corporate bond – lowest 
rated investment grade bond – declined by 93 bps, 
reflecting how liquidity stress has been eased across 
the board, impervious to ratings. Consequently, the 
spread on 1-year, 3-year, 5-year AAA and 3-year BBBrated corporate bonds declined by 180 bps, 145 bps, 96 
bps and 54 bps, respectively, during the period (Chart
36). The yield on the old 10-year G-sec benchmark (5.77 
GS 2030) slid on a declining trajectory to close at 
5.90 per cent on December 31, 2020 while the yield on 
the new 10-year G-sec benchmark (5.85 GS 2030) closed 
even lower at around 5.87 per cent on December 31,
2020. With the gradual unlocking of the economy 
and normalisation of activity setting in, improving 
demand conditions, easy rates and ample liquidity 
are expected to propel the flow of resources from the 
financial to the real sector.
Broader measures of liquidity mirrored these easy 
monetary conditions. Reserve money (RM) adjusted 
for the first-round impact of changes in the cash 
reserve ratio (CRR) increased by 18.3 per cent y-o-y as 
on January 8, 2021 (11.3 per cent a year ago), powered 
by the ongoing surge in currency in circulation (CiC) 
on the components side and net foreign assets 
(NFA) on the sources side (Chart 37). Money supply 
recorded a y-o-y growth of 12.5 per cent as on January 
1, 2021 (10.1 per cent a year ago), backed up by 
aggregate deposits growing by 10.9 per cent (9.8 per

cent a year ago). After a hiatus of five months, growth 
in scheduled commercial banks’ (SCBs) credit to 
commercial sector broke out of sub-6 per cent levels 
and picked up to 6.7 per cent as on January 1, 2021 
(7.5 per cent a year ago), responding to green shoots 
of recovery. SCBs’ investments in commercial paper, 
bonds, debentures and shares of corporate bodies 
on incremental terms stood at `434 crore during 
the year 2020-21 so far (up to January 1) as against a 
decline of `10,524 crore a year ago. On a cumulative 
basis, banks have extended credit of `2,93,007 crore 
to the commercial sector through April to January 
1, 2021 – an increase of 31.7 per cent over a year 
ago. The share of bank credit in the overall flow of 
funds increased from 29.8 per cent to 34.1 per cent 
during the period. Credit growth to agriculture and 
services sectors accelerated in November 2020, while 
credit to industry continued to contract (Chart 38). 
Personal loan growth slowed across the board with 
the exception of personal vehicle loans. Within the 
services sector, loans to transport, trade and tourism 
rose at a faster pace. While there was decline in 
overall credit growth to industry, credit to medium 
industry posted a robust increase and that to micro 
and small enterprises edged out of contraction, 
supported by measures designed by the Government 
and the Reserve Bank for these sectors.
Surplus liquidity conditions permeated into the 
credit market, easing interest rates all around. The 
median term deposit rate (MTDR) declined by 146 bps 
through March to December 2020, with a perceptible 
decline occurring in shorter tenor deposits of maturity

of up to one year (163 bps). The early adjustment in 
deposit rates, which is otherwise lagged, bodes well for 
transmission to lending rates, going forward. During 
the same period, the 1-year median MCLR softened 
cumulatively by 95 bps (Table 5). The asymmetry 
in transmission between deposit and lending rates 
needs to be seen in the context of persisting structural 
rigidities, with banks increasingly relying on retail 
deposits in preference to wholesale or market based 
funding.
With the gradual roll-back of the lockdown 
by easing restrictions and resumption of normal 
activities, trading hours for markets regulated by the 
Reserve Bank, which were earlier truncated effective 
April 7, 2020 were restored in a phased manner since 
November 9, 2020. Subsequently, it was announced 
on January 8, 2021 that normal liquidity management 
operations would be restored in a phased manner, 
beginning with a variable rate reverse repo auction 
conducted on January 15, 2021 under the revised 
liquidity management framework. At the same time, 
the fixed rate reverse repo remained fully operational 
with average daily absorption of liquidity of the order 
of `4.4 lakh crore between January 15 and the time 
of release of this article. While calibrating the gradual 
restoration of normal operations, the Reserve Bank 
has committed to ensure the availability of ample 
liquidity in the system to support congenial financial 
conditions and nurture the recovery.
The equity market hit new highs in its rally in 
December, lifted by increasing evidence that the 
recovery is gaining traction and supported by positive 
global cues in the form of the passage of the US 
stimulus package and the Brexit trade deal. Market 
exuberance led to Indian equities outpacing most 
global peers, with the BSE Sensex touching 47,751 
on December 31, 2020 - an increase of 83.8 per cent 
from its low of March 23, 2020 (25,981) (Chart 39

to investors, with 10 out of 13 IPOs generating 
positive listing day gains and all IPOs generating 
positive returns on an offer to date basis (Chart 42). 
Furthermore, most of these IPOs rallied beyond the 
listing day.
The listing day returns generated by IPOs for 
investors ranged between (-) 14.0 per cent and
130.7 per cent. In sectoral terms, food processing, 
information technology (IT) and chemicals sector 
generated the highest returns for investors (Table 6).
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows surged 
through August-November 2020, driven by fresh 
equity investments. Consequently, net FDI increased 
to US$ 34.1 billion in April-November 2020 from 
US$ 26.7 billion a year ago (Chart 43).
Net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows 
remained robust in December 2020, following an 
all-time intra-month high in November 2020. This 
may be attributed to the continued global monetary 
and fiscal stimulus, weakening of the US dollar 
and a robust revival in appetite for emerging market 
economies including India. In December 2020, 
net FPI inflows of US$ 8.6 billion were largely driven 
by equity purchases of US$ 7.3 billion by foreign

were FPI inflows of US$ 1.3 billion, the highest 
monthly accretion so far in the current financial year 
(Chart 44). Net investment under voluntary retention

In the foreign exchange market, the Indian rupee
(INR), buoyed by robust capital inflows on vaccine 
news, appreciated by 0.9 per cent against the US 
dollar in December 2020 over the previous month. By 
end-December 2020, the INR appreciated by 3.2 per 
cent over its level at end-March 2020, and closed 
at `73.05 against the US dollar, a level last seen in 
the beginning of September 2020. In terms of the

INR appreciated by 2.2 per cent in December 2020 
over March 2020 (Chart 45).

India’s external debt statistics as at 
end-September 2020 were released by the Ministry 
of Finance, Government of India, on December 31, 
2020. India’s external debt remained contained at 
US$ 556.2 billion. Lower external commercial 
borrowings, portfolio debt investment and shortterm trade credit caused the moderation in external 
debt. As at end-December 2020, reserves touched 
an all-time high of US$ 585.8 billion, equivalent to 
18.4 months of imports or 105.3 per cent of 
outstanding external debt as at end-September 2020 
(Chart 46).
The regulatory measures to deal with the 
COVID-19 pandemic entail forbearance across 
asset classes while maintaining credit supply and 
systemic resilience. Gross non-performing assets 
(GNPA) ratio of all SCBs has declined in successive 
quarters from 9.2 per cent in December 2019 to 
7.5 per cent in September 2020, which was aided 
significantly by the regulatory dispensations. Macro 
stress tests carried out in the latest Financial Stability 
Report (FSR) of January 2021 indicate that the GNPA 
ratio of SCBs may increase to 13.5 per cent by 
September 2021 under the baseline scenario, which 
may escalate to 14.8 per cent under a severe stress 
scenario (Chart 47).
At the aggregate level, SCBs have sufficient capital

of some banks may deplete below the regulatory 
minimum. Hence, going forward, mitigating actions 
such as phase-wise capital augmentation or other 
strategic actions would become relevant for these 
banks, from a micro prudential perspective.
Network analysis reveals that total bilateral 
exposures among entities in the financial system 
increased marginally during the quarter-ended 
September 2020; on the other hand, shrinking interbank market and capitalisation of banks reduced 
contagion risk to the banking system as compared 
with the March 2020 position.
Payment System
In the payments space, digital transactions 
continued to surge in December 2020, with both retail 
and wholesale transactions expanding in alignment 
with the broad basing of the economic recovery. 
As the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system, 
characterising the wholesale segment, was made 
available round the clock with effect from December 14,
2020, its volume growth (y-o-y) turned around sharply 
and rose by 20.0 per cent in December 2020 from 2.9 
per cent a month ago. Transaction values through 
RTGS, which had started declining since October 2019 
and had plummeted through the pandemic, posted a 
growth of 3.3 per cent in December 2020.
In the retail segment, national electronic funds 
transfer (NEFT) transactions grew by 31.6 per cent 
in volume in December 2020 as compared with 24.6 
per cent recorded a month ago. In value terms, NEFT 
transactions rose by 31.7 and 27.9 per cent, respectively.
Unified payment interface (UPI) transaction volume 
remained above the historic 2.2 billion mark attained 
last month, while transaction values increased 
by 105.5 per cent over December 2019 (Table 7). 
Transactions through immediate payment service 
(IMPS), national electronic toll collection (NETC) and 
Bharat bill payment system (BBPS) surged, hitting 
double digit levels in both volume and value growth. 
Cash withdrawals also point towards the economy 
poised on the cusp of a recovery.
A distinct pattern of preference shifting towards 
digital payments is becoming evident this year, with 
increasing e-commerce penetration, the growing 
footprint of BigTech in the payment space and 
competitive pressures on banks to upgrade their 
payment eco-systems. Incentives such as cashbacks, 
discounts on e-commerce portals, easy EMI and 
buy now, pay later schemes have built a widening 
customer base. They have also promoted increasing 
use of digital payments and are driving up transaction 
volumes in retail payment systems, especially on 
the UPI. As competition in the payments industry 
is set to intensify, with newer entrants offering 
greater incentives for people to pay digitally, India 
may emerge from the pandemic more digital than 
ever before. This can bolster consumer spending and 
increase the degree of formalisation of economy.
The Reserve Bank now announced opening of the 
second cohort under its Regulatory Sandbox (RS) with
‘Cross Border Payments,’ as its theme. India is the 
largest recipient of inbound remittances across the 
globe, accounting for 15 per cent of global flows. In the 
year 2019, India received US$ 83 billion and in the first

V. Conclusion
What will 2021 look like? The shape of the 
recovery will be v-shaped after all and the ‘v’ stands 
for vaccine. On January 16, India launched the 
biggest vaccination drive in the world, backed by its 
comparative advantage of having the largest vaccine 
manufacturing capacity in the world and a rich 
experience of mass inoculation drives against polio 
and measles. If successful, it will tilt the balance of 
risks upwards. E-commerce and digital technologies 
will likely be the bright spots in India’s recovery in 
a world in which there will be rebounds for sure, 
but pre-pandemic levels of output and employment 
are a long way off. Japanification stares at much of 
the advanced world, while for emerging economies, 
potential output will be a lot flatter.
Recent shifts in the macroeconomic landscape 
have brightened the outlook, with GDP in striking 
distance of attaining positive territory and inflation 
easing closer to the target. If these movements 
sustain, policy space could open up to further support 
the recovery. Merchandise trade has rebounded in 
early January, attesting the slow healing of domestic 
demand and the unlocking of export energies. Current 
account surpluses are ebbing as domestic activity 
regains vigour. Foreign investment flows are already 
scenting the imminent upturn. The recent new highs 
scaled by equity markets are driven by optimism 
around early Q3 corporate earnings results, with IT 
majors including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys 
and Wipro recording strong growth.
In H1:2021-22, GDP growth will benefit 
from statistical support and is likely to be mostly 
consumption-driven. With rabi sowing surpassing 
the normal acreage way before the end of the 
season, bumper agriculture production is expected 
in 2021. India being the global capital for vaccine 
manufacturing, pharmaceuticals exports are expected 
to receive a big impetus with the start of vaccination 
drives globally. Agricultural exports remain resilient 
and under the recent production linked (PLI) scheme, 
food processing industry has been accorded priority. 
Harnessing the synergies by transforming low-value 
semi-processed agri products through food processing 
would not only improve productivity but also boost 
India’s competitiveness.
Developments in 2020 have ushered in a new 
digital transformation on the back of strengthening 
consumption demand and growing corporate sector 
business transactions. According to the World 
Economic Forum’s report - Indian Cities in the Post 
Pandemic - released on January 7, 2021, the pandemic 
presents a historic opportunity to build back better 
and create a new urban paradigm – one that enables 
Indian cities to be healthier, more inclusive, and more 
resilient. An urban reform agenda can be set up across 
seven thematic pillars: planning; housing; transport; 
environment; public health; gender; and vulnerable 
populations.
The need to kickstart investment is acquiring 
urgency to secure a durable turnaround and a sustainable 
growth trajectory. India must look for ways in which 
cash sitting idly in balance sheets of corporations and 
banks and reverse repo balances with the Reserve 
Bank finds their way into credit to productive sectors 
and into real spending on investment activity before 
it imposes a persistent deflationary weight on real 
activity. Stress in the financial sector’s balance sheet 
could intensify as the camouflage of moratorium, 
asset classification standstill and restructuring 
fades, but banks have entered the health crisis with 
stronger capital buffers than the global financial crisis.
