thereby rendering sterilised interventions ineffective.
Moreover, this risk intensifies as the magnitude of
sterilisation increases. In this context, capital flows
management measures (CFMs) could enhance the
effectiveness of sterilised interventions to some
extent. For instance, if portfolio investments in both
government securities and corporate bonds are capped
(as in India), additional portfolio inflows would not
materialise even when sterilised intervention widens
the yield differential.
This paper presents in detail as to how the RBI’s
forex market interventions have impacted domestic
liquidity conditions, and how they have been managed.
The study is organised into five sections. Section II
sets out the mechanics of forex market intervention,
its consequences, and cross-country practices in
managing the liquidity impact of such intervention
through alternative instruments. Recent episodes of
capital flows and their attendant challenges in the
Indian context are discussed in Section III, while the
effectiveness of sterilised intervention is empirically
assessed in Section IV. Concluding observations are
presented in Section V.

II. Capital Flows and Forex Market Interventions in
India
Since the onset of external sector reforms in the
early 1990s and with the progressive deregulation of
the capital account, India has experienced episodes
of surges in capital inflows and sporadic sudden
stops/reversals. Theoretically, while capital inflows
are required to finance a sustainable current account
deficit in an ex ante sense, capital inflows, however,
have often exceeded the financing requirement,
driven by favourable interest rate differentials and/
or more promising growth outlook, leading to an
overall surplus position in the balance of payments in
most years (Chart 1). Given the objective of avoiding
disruptive excess volatility in the exchange rate of the
rupee, RBI’s intervention through purchases led to an
accretion in foreign exchange reserves.
In an integrated global financial system,
capital inflows pose multiple challenges for overall
macroeconomic management. While there are
several available tools – ranging from (i) forex market
intervention; (ii) fiscal/monetary policy measures;
(iii) macro-prudential regulations; and (iv) imposition

of capital controls – to moderate the impact of
such inflows, the moot issue is about managing the
trade-offs while deploying these instruments either
individually or in some optimal mix. This paper,
however, solely focusses on forex market intervention
and its impact on domestic liquidity conditions.
When a central bank purchases foreign currency,
its net foreign assets (NFA) increase, resulting in
expansion of primary liquidity or reserve money (RM)
(Table 1). In this context, it is important to assess
whether the increase in RM resulting from an increase
in NFA is: (a) consistent with the required increase in
RM during the year, in which case no sterilisation may
be necessary; (b) higher than the required increase in
RM, thereby necessitating sterilisation; and (c) less
than the required increase in RM in which case the
central bank may have to inject liquidity over and
above what is already injected through intervention.
Unsterilised intervention on a continuous
basis can lead to a surfeit of liquidity with attendant
implications for inflation, which, in turn, could
result in hikes in the policy interest rate. Such hikes

may, however, widen the interest rate differential,
thereby triggering further inflows. Thus, unsterilised
interventions often defeat the very objective of
intervention; hence, central banks generally conduct
sterilisation operations to neutralise the monetary
impact of its operations in the foreign exchange
market. Sterilised intervention through open market
purchase of securities, however, also keeps interest
rates elevated in the economy, as alluded to earlier.
There are also limits to intervention operations as
central banks may be constrained by the availability
of government securities for sterilisation. As a result,
several other instruments have been used by most
central banks with varying degree of effectiveness
(Table 2).

Forex Market Operations and Liquidity Management

III. Forex Operations and Liquidity Management in
India – Recent Episodes
As emphasised by the Report of the Expert
Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary
Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R. Patel), the
desirable evolution of the base money path (without
rigid adherence to any base money rule) is a key
component of the liquidity management strategy
[Pillar II as distinct from Pillar I, which is about day
to day liquidity management under the liquidity
adjustment facility (LAF)]. For instance, increase in NFA
in 2014-15 was higher than the actual increase in RM
(consistent with the annual increase in nominal GDP),
necessitating open market operations (OMO) (sales)
to absorb excess durable surplus liquidity (Table 3). In
contrast, in 2013-14 and 2015-16, the actual increase in
RM was significantly higher than the increase in NFA,
which necessitated OMO (purchases) by the Reserve
Bank for injecting durable liquidity. The year 2016-17
was an exceptional year as the problem of large surplus
liquidity post-demonetisation was exacerbated by
the increase in NFA. In 2017-18, while the liquidity
overhang from demonetisation moderated gradually
with increasing remonetisation thus taking the system
level liquidity closer to neutrality, primary durable
liquidity increased due to forex inflows which was
partly offset through OMO (sales), consistent with the
Pillar II approach mentioned above.

It is pertinent to note that forward purchases of
foreign exchange that are due to mature over the next
few months can lead to injection of durable liquidity,
unless rolled over. Thus, while forward forex market
interventions/rollovers could relax the liquidity
management challenges, such an approach carries the
risk of distorting forward rates (with forward rates
being also influenced by demand-supply conditions at
the margin, besides interest rate differentials).
Forex interventions change significantly the
composition of the RBI’s balance sheet (in terms of the
sources of expansion in reserve money), which also
poses challenges. A high share of NFA at any point in
time and the resultant decline in net domestic assets
(NDA) can pose collateral constraints to the Reserve
Bank’s market-based liquidity absorption operations,
particularly open market sales and reverse repo
auctions to absorb surplus liquidity. Under conditions
of persistently large surplus liquidity, this constraint
could become binding. For instance, the sharp rise
in the share of foreign assets in total assets in the
RBI’s balance sheet between 2001 and 2003 (Chart 2)
necessitated the introduction of Market Stabilisation
Scheme (MSS) in April 2004.2 Thereafter, the share of
foreign assets kept increasing, reaching almost 89 per
cent in 2006 and 2008; however, the Reserve Bank was
able to effectively sterilise surplus liquidity by issuing
securities under the MSS along with the cash reserve

2 The MSS was designed to absorb surplus liquidity of an enduring nature through issuance of Treasury Bills and dated Government securities. The proceeds
were parked in a separate identifiable cash account maintained and operated by the Reserve Bank, which could be appropriated only for the purpose of
redemption and/or buyback of papers issued under the MSS.

ratio (CRR) and OMO sales. This ensured that the
burden of sterilisation was shared by all stakeholders,
i.e., (i) the Government (interest cost on MSS);
(ii) the Reserve Bank (interest cost on reverse repos);
and (iii) the banking sector (unremunerated reserve
requirements). Capital outflows in the wake of the
global financial crisis and large scale OMO purchases
to meet the normal expansion in RM in the following
years (up to 2012-13) led to some moderation in
the share of foreign assets in the total assets of the
Reserve Bank; however, this ratio has started rising
in recent years. The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF),
which has been announced in the Union Budget 2018-
19, once operationalised, will significantly enhance
the sterilisation capacity by removing the collateral
constraint that the Reserve Bank occasionally faced in
the past.
IV. Estimating the Effectiveness of Sterilised
Interventions
As noted earlier, central banks that intervene
in the foreign exchange market typically calibrate
the extent of sterilisation to modulate base money
expansion in sync with the normal requirements of
a growing economy and its monetary policy stance. In

the Indian context also, forex market intervention is
offset to the extent required through changes in net
domestic assets so as to ensure that the base money
expansion remains consistent with the growth in
nominal GDP.
The extent and effectiveness of sterilisation
operations undertaken by a central bank are
empirically measured by computing sterilisation and
offset coefficients, both varying between 0 and -1. The
sterilisation coefficient measures the extent by which
the NDA of a central bank change in response to a
change in NFA. Typically, while a value of -1 represents
complete sterilisation, i.e., no impact of surplus capital
inflows on the monetary base, a value of 0 implies that
forex intervention is not sterilised at all by the central
bank.
As discussed earlier, sterilisation operations
undertaken by a central bank can widen the interest
rate differential if such operations are undertaken
through open market sale of securities, which, in turn,
could result in higher capital inflows, thereby leading
to an adverse feedback loop. If interest sensitive
capital flows are large (or the sensitivity of capital
flows to widening interest rate differentials is high),

and if open market sales, as the key instrument of
sterilisation, harden yields, then the sterilisation
effort could become ineffective. The offset coefficient
captures this combined effect, i.e., the extent to which
a decrease in NDA due to open market sales is offset by

an increase in net foreign assets driven by sterilisation-
induced higher yields. If sterilisation operations result

in a widening of interest rate differential, the change
in net domestic assets can be fully offset through a
change in net foreign assets. In this scenario, a value
of -1 for the offset coefficient represents the complete
ineffectiveness of the central bank in sterilising capital
flows, i.e., complete attenuation of monetary control.
Thus, an offset coefficient of -1 would tantamount to
perfect capital mobility, while a value of 0 would imply
no capital mobility, which is also consistent with the
impossible trinity, according to which fixed exchange
rate, perfect capital mobility and independent
monetary policy are mutually incompatible.
In the Indian context, several studies have
estimated the “sterilisation coefficient”, but there
are very few studies that have estimated the “offset
coefficient”, notable exceptions being Pattanaik (1997)
and Ouyang and Rajan (2008). While the former found
the offset coefficient to be in the range of -0.31 and -0.33,
the latter estimated it to be between -0.79 and -0.84.
These findings indicate that the offset coefficient has
increased in India over time given that the exposure
of the economy to short-term portfolio debt flows has
increased gradually through successive increases in FPI
limits on Government securities, state development

loans (SDLs) and corporate bonds reflecting increasing
openness of the capital account. Moreover, the yield
differential has remained significantly favourable for
India in the post global crisis period because of the
persistently low interest rates in advanced economies.
Using monthly data for over a 20-year period
from July 1997 to October 2017, the sterilisation and
offset coefficients are estimated by a modified money
demand function and a modified equation on capital
flows using the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method
(Annex). The estimated sterilisation coefficient is
-1.03 while the offset coefficient is -0.83, which are
consistent with the findings of Ouyang and Rajan, op.
cit, (Table 4).
Conclusion
Sterilised intervention in India has not only
ensured that the reserve money growth remains
consistent with the requirements of the growing
economy but also that money market rates remain
aligned with the operating target of the monetary
policy, no matter how significant and persistent the
liquidity impact of forex interventions may be. The
estimated large offset coefficient, however, suggests
that the impossible trinity poses a challenge to the
effective conduct of monetary policy. Forex market
intervention requires a continuous assessment of
exchange market conditions (in terms of intervention
preventing volatility), liquidity conditions (arising
out of forex operations) relative to system wide
demand for liquidity, G-sec market conditions (in

terms of sensitivity of yields to OMOs) and forward
market conditions (in terms of forward premia getting
influenced by forward purchases/sales).
Many EMEs have successfully managed the
impossibility trinity by adopting country and
time-specific suitable mix of sterilisation, exchange
rate flexibility and CFMs. In the foreseeable future,
India may have to persevere with the past strategy
which has stood the test of time, even while further
strengthening the arsenal for sterilisation.
