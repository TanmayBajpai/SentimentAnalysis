Changes in Macroeconomic Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
This article presents an analysis of annual and 
quarterly forecasts of major macroeconomic variables in the 
Reserve Bank’s bimonthly survey of professional forecasters 
(SPF). Forecast of output growth and CPI inflation for 
2018-19 and 2019-20 was revised down. The forecast 
path of exclusion based CPI inflation was gradually 
revised up for 2018-19 but lowered for 2019-20. Forecast 
performance improves with reduction in forecast horizon, 
indicating forecasters’ tendency to update their forecasts 
with incoming information and provide more accurate 
estimates as they approach closer to the final estimate 
of the underlying indicator. The forecasts are found 
efficient for headline CPI inflation and exclusion based 
CPI inflation. Disagreement measures for GVA growth 
have remained close to its medium term average for all 
the forecast horizons in the recent period. The general 
behaviour of the inflation uncertainty largely shows that 
uncertainty moderated since November 2018. 
Introduction
Economic agents have to often form expectations 
about the future trajectory of an economy to be able 
to take rational economic decisions, with complete 
prior knowledge, though the future is uncertain and 
the actual evolution of the economy may deviate 
from their expectations. For the conduct of monetary 
policy, given the challenges of long and variable lags in 
transmission, aggregated information on expectations 
of economic agents about the key economic parameters 
can be a useful input for setting the near to mediumterm outlook for the economy. Unlike other forward 
looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank that

Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional 
Forecasters*
collect information on expectations of households 
and firms, the survey of professional forecasters 
directly collects forecasts of key macro-economic 
parameters. Since professional forecasters generally 
monitor multiple domestic and global parameters, it 
is perceived that they can give forward looking views 
with better precision. 
The Reserve Bank has been conducting its 
survey of professional forecasters since the second 
quarter of 2007-08. The SPF panellists are drawn 
from both financial and non-financial institutions, 
which have established research set up and bring out 
regular updates on the Indian economy. Initially, the 
survey was conducted at a quarterly frequency, which 
was changed to bi-monthly in 2014-15 (28th round) 
after the change was introduced in the periodicity 
of the monetary policy review cycle. The survey 
questionnaire has broadly retained its character on 
major parameters, but certain modifications were 
incorporated to meet the evolving requirements. 
In every bi-monthly round, the survey collects 
annual quantitative forecasts for two financial years 
(current year and next year) and quarterly forecasts 
for five quarters (current quarter and the next four 
quarters). It covers 25 macroeconomic indicators 
including national accounts aggregates, inflation, 
money and banking, public finance and external sector. 
The survey solicits expectations of inflation, in terms 
of consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price 
index (WPI), and economic growth, in terms of gross 
value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP). 
The results are summarised in terms of the median of 
the responses received from the SPF panellists.
The survey questionnaire also includes questions 
on the estimate of probability distribution of annual 
output growth for two financial years (current and next 
year) and quarterly inflation based on the consumer 
price index - combined (for four quarters ahead). 
For these density forecasts, respondents are asked to 
provide a probability distribution of forecast outcomes 
along a given set of intervals for each macroeconomic 
variable (viz., output growth and inflation). The 
article

Changes in Macroeconomic Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
estimated probability distribution helps to assess the 
extent of uncertainty in their forecasts.
This article presents an analysis of SPF responses 
received since March 2018, when the number of 
survey responses ranged from 25 to 32 in different 
rounds of the survey. Section II presents a brief review 
of similar surveys conducted by other central banks. 
Section III discusses revisions in median forecasts 
of major macroeconomic indicators for the years 
2018-19 and 2019-20 over successive rounds. Section 
IV evaluates the forecast performance while measures 
of uncertainty and disagreement are presented in 
Section V. Section VI sets out concluding observations. 
II. Review of Similar Surveys Conducted by Other 
Central Banks
In the United States of America, the American 
Statistical Association (ASA) and the National Bureau 
of Economic Research (NBER) jointly conducted 
the first quarterly SPF for the US economy in 1968. 
Subsequently it is being continued by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia since 1990. The survey 
collects comprehensive forecasts of economic and 
financial market indicators for both short and longterm1
. The point forecasts include forecasts of output 
growth, non-farm payroll employment, unemployment 
rate, yield on government bills/bonds, corporate bond 
yields, corporate profits, private sector housing starts, 
inflation, etc. Besides these point forecasts, the survey 
also collects information on mean probability of 
unemployment rate, real output growth and inflation. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) has been 
conducting their quarterly SPF since 1999. It collects 
point forecasts and mean probability of real GDP 
growth, unemployment rate and inflation rate, 
both headline and excluding energy, food, alcohol 
and tobacco in the euro area2
. Point forecasts are 
also solicited for labour cost, Brent crude oil price, 
USD/EUR exchange rate and the ECB’s interest rate for 
its main refinancing operations. 
The Bank of England has been conducting the 
quarterly Survey of External Forecasters since 1996, 
covering participants from city firms, academic 
institutions and private consultancies, predominantly 
based in London. The survey collects point forecasts 
of inflation, GDP growth, unemployment rate, Bank 
Rate, etc., for the next three years. The results of the 
survey are regularly published in the Bank’s Inflation 
Report. 
The Central Bank of Brazil conducts the ‘Focus 
Survey’ for monitoring the market expectations 
on inflation, output growth and other fiscal and 
external indicators on a daily basis3
. The survey is 
canvassed among 140 banks, asset managers and other 
institutions including real sector companies, brokers, 
consultancies, etc. 
The quarterly Survey of Expectations conducted 
by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand collects 
point forecasts of inflation, real output growth, 
unemployment rate, besides a few financial market 
variables with a focus on inflation indicators. Inflation 
forecasts are collected for the short-term and longterm4
, while real GDP growth forecasts are collected for 
the next two-years. The survey covers both business 
managers and professionals. The review suggests that 
central banks in many countries widely use the survey 
of professional forecasters to assess their expectations 
on important macroeconomic indicators. Such surveys 
also enable to assess the uncertainty prevailing in the 
economy. Their views provide valuable insights in 
setting the near to medium-term economic outlook.
III. Revisions in SPF Median Forecasts of Select 
Macroeconomic Indicators
During March 2018 to March 2019, seven SPF 
rounds were conducted (51st round to 57th round) by 
the Reserve Bank. The annual forecasts for national 
accounts aggregates for 2018-19 were collected till the 
March 2019 round5
.
1The survey collects forecasts for the next five quarters (quarterly indicators), 
four years (annual indicators) and ten years (long-term).
2The annual forecast covers the next three years horizon and the long-term 
pertains to the average of next five years. 
3 Information extracted from the website of Central Bank of Brazil (www.
bcb.gov.br/en/monetarypolicy/marketexpectations)
4The short-term forecasts cover 1-year and 2-year ahead while the long-term 
forecasts cover both 5-years ahead and 10-years ahead horizons.
5Provisional estimates for 2018-19 were released by the National Statistical 
Office (NSO) on May 31, 2019.

Changes in Macroeconomic Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
III.1. Annual Forecasts for 2018-19
Forecasts of real GDP growth for 2018-19 
remained unchanged at 7.4 per cent during the survey 
rounds conducted during May 2018 to November 2018. 
These were subsequently revised down by 20 basis 
points (bps) each over the subsequent two rounds to 
7.0 per cent by March 2019 (Table 1). Concomitantly, 
the forecast path of growth in real gross value added 
(GVA) was also revised down. The downward revisions 
in the GDP growth forecasts since the November 2018 
round of the survey coincided with the downward 
revision in the real GDP growth published by the 
National Statistical Office (NSO)6
. The initial median 
SPF forecast of GDP growth in 2018-19 was about 50 
bps higher when compared to the official estimate 
of 6.8 per cent (provisional) released subsequently. 
The lowering of growth forecasts by the professional 
forecasters was concomitant with the downward 
revision in the real gross fixed capital formation 
(GFCF) growth rate by the NSO7
 and decline in certain 
high frequency indicators such as domestic production 
of capital goods8
 and consumption of finished steel. 
Incidentally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
also revised down the world GDP growth forecast for 
2019 from 3.7 per cent projected in October 2018 to 
3.5 per cent in January 2019, which is an indication of 
global demand conditions turning adverse for India’s 
outlook for GDP growth and exports.
The median forecast of average headline CPI 
inflation for 2018-19 remained in the range of 4.5-
4.7 per cent during the survey rounds conducted 
during March-September 2018, which was revised 
down to 3.4 per cent in the March 2019 round of 
the survey. While March 2019 forecasts matched the 
realised inflation rate, initial forecasts overestimated 
it by about 110 to 130 bps. Forecast of inflation in ‘CPI 
excluding food and beverages, fuel and light, pan, 
tobacco and intoxicants’ (hereinafter called ‘exclusion 
based CPI’) was revised up from 5.1 per cent in the 
March 2018 round to 5.8 per cent in the March 2019 
round, which matched the actual print. The consistent 
downward revision in forecasts of headline inflation, 
combined with the stability in forecasts of exclusion 
based CPI inflation since the September 2018 round, 
suggest consistent moderation in inflation assessment 
for food and fuel during the course of the year9
. The 
6The first advance estimates for 2018-19 released by the NSO on January 7, 2019 put the real GDP growth at 7.2 per cent, which was revised down to 7.0 
per cent in the second advance estimates released on February 28, 2019. It may be mentioned that the real GDP growth rate for 2017-18 was revised upward 
to 7.2 per cent as per the first revised estimates released on February 28, 2019 from the provisional estimate of 6.7 per cent, which also contributed to 
downward revision in GDP growth for 2018-19 as per second advance estimates. Subsequently, as per the provisional estimates released on May 31, 2019, 
real GDP growth for 2018-19 was further revised down to 6.8 per cent.
7For the year 2018-19, the NSO revised down the real GFCF growth rate from 12.2 per cent as per the first advance estimates to 10.0 per cent in the second 
advance estimates. 
8Based on high frequency monthly industrial production data.
9Given the larger weight of food group (45.8 per cent) in the CPI basket, the decline in headline forecast is likely to be coming from decline in food inflation 
expectation. Fuel has a weight of 6.84 per cent.

subdued realised food inflation, and the deflation over 
five consecutive months starting with October 2018, 
contributed to the downward revisions in the headline 
inflation projection path. 
The current account deficit (CAD) for 2018-19 was 
pegged at 2.1 per cent (as per cent of GDP at current 
market value) in the March 2018 round of the survey, 
which was gradually revised up to 2.7 per cent in 
the November 2018 round, in tandem with the rise 
in crude oil prices and the depreciation of the Indian 
Rupee during this period. The Indian crude oil basket 
prices increased by about 25.0 per cent from US$ 63.9 
per barrel in March 2018 to around US$ 80.0 per barrel 
in October 2018. During the same period, the Indian 
Rupee also depreciated by around 12.0 per cent against 
the US Dollar. With the subsequent drop in the Indian 
crude oil basket prices and appreciation of the Rupee, 
forecast of CAD was revised down to 2.4 per cent in the 
March 2019 round of the survey. The actual CAD for 
the year turned out to be 2.1 per cent of GDP, which is 
what the professional forecasters had projected at the 
beginning of the year.
Forecasts of centre’s fiscal deficit (as per cent of 
GDP at current market prices) remained unchanged 
at 3.3 per cent till the November 2018 round of the 
survey and subsequently revised up to 3.4 per cent in 
the March 2019 round, which was same as the actual 
outcome. Forecasts of combined fiscal deficit of central 
and state governments remained in the range of 6.1-
6.4 per cent all through the year, which was in line 
with the actual print of 6.2 per cent.
III.2. Annual Forecast for 2019-20
The median GDP growth forecast for 2019-20 was 
placed at around 7.5 per cent in the initial four rounds 
of the survey conducted during May 2018 to November 
2018 (Table 2), which was revised down by 20 bps to 
7.3 per cent in the January 2019 round and further by 
30 bps to 6.9 per cent in the July 2019 round. After the 
release of the GDP growth numbers for the first quarter 
of 2019-20 (5.0 per cent) by the NSO, in the September 
2019 round, median forecast of GDP growth for 2019-20 
was further revised down to 6.2 per cent, about 130 bps 
lower than initial forecasts reported during May 2018 
to November 2018 round. The downward revision in 
GDP growth forecast reflected both subdued domestic 
demand conditions and weak consumer sentiments. 
Forecast of real private final consumption expenditure 
(PFCE) growth was revised down by 250 bps from 8.0 
per cent in the May 2019 round to 5.5 per cent in the 
September 2019 round, reflecting lower households 
demand as indicated by moderation in the production 
of consumer durables10. Forecast of real GFCF growth 
rate was revised down cumulatively by 340 bps during 
March 2019 to September 2019.

Changes in Macroeconomic Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
The median forecasts of inflation for 2019-20 were 
also revised down significantly since the November 
2018 round of the survey. During the September 
2018 round and November 2018 round, the average 
inflation for 2019-20 was pegged at 4.8 per cent by 
the professional forecasters, which was revised down 
gradually over the next five rounds by 130 bps to 3.5 
per cent in the September 2019 round. The forecast 
of exclusion based CPI inflation was revised down 
successively from 5.2 per cent in the January 2019 
round to 4.1 per cent in the July 2019 before revising 
up marginally to 4.2 per cent in the September 2019 
round, in synchrony with the successive downward 
revision in GDP growth during the period. Headline CPI 
inflation forecast remained reasonably stable during 
last four rounds of the survey even as exclusion based 
CPI inflation forecasts were revised down, implicitly 
suggesting higher food inflation expectation during 
this period. The downward revision in the exclusion 
based CPI inflation forecasts were attendant to the 
widening of negative output gap, softening of crude oil 
prices and an appreciation of the Indian Rupee against 
the US Dollar during the period. Inflation forecasts 
for WPI headline and WPI non-food manufactured 
products for 2019-20 were also revised down over 
this period and stood at 1.8 per cent and 0.5 per cent, 
respectively, in the September 2019 round.
The median forecast of CAD to GDP ratio for 
2019-20 was revised up from 2.4 per cent in the May 
2018 round to 2.6 per cent in the November 2018 
round. The forecast was subsequently revised down to 
1.9 per cent in the September 2019 round, on account 
of softening of crude oil prices, appreciation of the 
domestic currency as well as lower domestic demand. 
III.3. Revisions in Quarterly Growth Path
Quarterly output growth forecast path for the first 
three quarters of 2018-19 broadly remained unchanged, 
with forecast for Q3:2018-19 remaining within 
the range of 6.9-7.2 per cent in the survey rounds 
conducted during March 2018 to January 2019 (Table 
3). For Q4:2018-19, growth forecast was successively 
revised down from 7.3 per cent in the May 2018 round 
to 6.5 per cent in the March 2019 round, while the 
actual print was lower at 5.8 per cent. For the year 
2019-20, the output growth forecast path was revised 
down significantly since the January 2019 round of the 
survey. For Q1:2019-20, growth forecast was revised 
down from 7.2 per cent in the November 2018 round 
to 6.1 per cent in the July 2019 round. The extent of 
downward revision in the last three rounds of the 
survey was more prominent for the near term11, while 
the downward revision for three and four quarter 
horizons has been relatively less. The continued 
slowdown in the domestic private consumption 
demand and investment growth, coupled with likely 
lower global output growth, led to downward revision 
in the GDP growth forecast path. 
11Near term indicates forecast for the next two quarters.

round for all the quarters of 2019-20 as also for 
Q1:2020-21. 
CPI headline inflation forecast for Q1:2019-20 
was revised down from 5.1 per cent in the July 2018 
round to 3.1 per cent in the May 2019 round12, with 
substantial downward revision made during the 
November 2018 to the March 2019 rounds. The decline 
in headline inflation forecasts may be attributed 
to low food inflation as well as softening in energy 
prices. Forecasts of exclusion based CPI inflation for 
Q1:2019-20 were also sequentially revised down from 
the November 2018 round to the May 2019 round. 
Headline inflation forecast for Q2:2019-20 
was revised down successively from 5.1 per cent 
in the September 2018 round to 3.3 per cent in the 
September 2019 round, while forecast of exclusion 
based CPI inflation was revised down from 5.4 per 
cent in the November 2018 round to 4.2 per cent in 
the September 2019 round. The initial uncertainty 
surrounding the progress of South-west monsoon 
for 2019 led to some firming up of food inflation 
expectations, which led to upward revision in the 
headline inflation forecast during the May 2019 round 
for the near term forecast horizon. On the other hand, 
forecast for exclusion based CPI inflation continued 
to be revised down, despite an increase in the crude 
oil prices during January 2019 to May 2019, reflecting 
lower than expected growth in domestic demand. 
The quarterly forecast paths for WPI headline 
inflation and WPI non-food manufactured products 
inflation were revised up during March 2018 to 
November 2018, for all the quarters till Q2:2019-20 
and revised down thereafter. The actual prints of WPI 
headline inflation and WPI non-food manufactured 
products inflation turned out to be higher than the 
forecasts for Q1 and Q2 of 2018-19, but matched 
the final estimates of 2.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent, 
respectively, for Q4:2018-19. The quarterly forecast 
paths for 2019-20 have largely been revised down 
since the November 2018 round.
IV. Empirical Assessment of Forecasts 
IV.1. Accuracy of the Quarterly Forecasts
The accuracy of the median SPF forecasts during 
Q1:2014-15 to Q2:2019-20 has been empirically tested 
for three important quarterly indicators, viz., (i) 
output growth measured using real GVA, (ii) headline 
CPI inflation, and (iii) exclusion based CPI inflation. 
Forecast errors have been analysed in terms of three 
alternative criteria, viz., (a) the mean error (ME), (b) 
the mean absolute error (MAE) and (c) the root mean 
squared error (RMSE) as described below:
•	 Mean error (ME): Average deviation of actual 
outcome of the indicator from its forecast
 •	 Mean absolute error (MAE): Average absolute 
deviation of actual outcome of the indicator 
from its forecast
•	 Root mean squared error (RMSE): Square root of 
the average squared deviation of actual outcome 
of the indicator from its forecast
where yi
 and are the actual and forecast 
numbers, respectively.
MAE and RMSE are more popular measures 
since they do not allow for cancelling out of errors in 
opposite directions. Even though these two measures 
assess the absolute size of errors quite well, they do 
not measure the important aspect of average bias in 
forecasts, which is estimated by the mean error (ME). 
Recently, these measures have been used to compare 
the inflation forecast performance of India with some 
other countries (Raj, et. al., 2019).
12The forecast of headline inflation for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in 
line with the actual print of 3.1 per cent.

22 RBI Bulletin November 2019
Changes in Macroeconomic Perceptions: Evidence from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters
The comparison of forecast accuracy for GVA13
growth, CPI inflation and exclusion based CPI inflation 
are presented in Table 5. All measures indicate that 
forecast performance improves with reduction in 
forecast horizon, indicating forecasters’ tendency to 
update their forecast with incoming new information 
and provide more accurate updated estimates as they 
approach closer to the final official data release of the 
underlying indicator. 
During the reference period, the SPF panellists 
over-predicted headline CPI inflation, as reflected 
in negative mean errors, where the average upward 
bias was (-)100 bps (Table 5, panel a). In contrast, 
the forecasts of exclusion based CPI inflation had 
no systematic bias during the reference period. GVA 
growth forecasts had marginal upward bias, with 
average mean error of (-)10 bps. 
Mean absolute error as well as RMSE were 
generally lower for GVA growth as compared to CPI 
inflation for all forecast horizons. The mean absolute 
error (averaged across all the four forecast horizons) 
was 90 bps for GVA growth as compared to 110 bps 
and 80 bps, for headline CPI inflation and exclusion 
based CPI inflation, respectively (Table 5, panel b). 
The RMSE for GVA growth was 100 bps whereas for 
CPI inflation and exclusion based CPI inflation, it 
averaged 150 bps and 130 bps, respectively (Table 5, 
panel c). The statistical significance of the errors has 
been addressed in the next section, with the caveat of 
relatively small sample period.
IV.2. Testing for Efficiency of the Forecasts 
An efficient forecast makes use of all the available 
information at the time of making the forecast and its 
error should ideally not be systematically correlated 
with the information which is available at the time 
of generating forecasts. Accordingly, the realised 
inflation / growth should not be related to the forecast 
error (Raj, op. cit. (2019)). Consider,
et+q,t = αq
+ βq yt-1 + ut+q,t
where et+q,t is the q-quarter ahead forecast 
error, αq and βq are constant and slope parameters, 
respectively, yt-1 is the actual value of underlying 
indicator in the previous quarter and ut+q,t is the 
residual term.
For an efficient forecast, the coefficient βq should 
be statistically insignificant. In view of the relatively 
limited sample size, we restrict the analysis only to 
one- and two- quarters ahead forecasts. The forecasts 
are found to be efficient for headline CPI inflation and 
exclusion based CPI inflation for both the forecast 
horizons. On the other hand, GVA growth forecasts 
are found to be efficient for two-quarters ahead 
horizon but, for one-quarter ahead horizon, the test 
rejects the null hypothesis that forecasts are efficient. 
(Table 6). In this context, it is important to note that 
unlike CPI data, which are not revised after one and 
half month from the reference period, GVA estimates 
undergo revisions more than once.

V. Disagreement and Uncertainty in Forecasts
Risk and uncertainty are integral part of any 
forecasting exercise and macroeconomic predictions 
are no exceptions. Uncertainty in forecasting arises 
from inherent randomness of the economic process 
and inter-linkages. Understanding the process of 
expectation formation and measurement of forecast 
uncertainty are crucial inputs for effective policymaking. Nevertheless, in practice, measuring 
uncertainty is challenging due to the twin problem 
of measuring individual forecaster’s subjective 
assessment as well as unavailability of data on 
economic uncertainty. Although most of the forecast 
surveys provide a direct measure of expectation, 
the scope for measuring uncertainty is limited since 
only a handful of surveys collect information on 
both point forecasts as well as density forecasts, the 
latter providing the information for measuring 
uncertainty.
Surveys that collect both point and density 
forecasts can be used to construct measures of 
uncertainty and their relationship with forecast 
disagreement and predictive accuracy. As the SPF 
collects point and density forecasts of key economic 
variables, viz., output growth and inflation rate, 
uncertainty and disagreement measures are compiled 
based on those respondents who provided both 
information.
Drawing upon the work of Zarnowitz and Lambros 
(1987), forecast uncertainty is measured under the 
assumption of a uniform probability distribution 
within each interval of the density forecast. 
The variance of the i
th respondent’s density forecast 
in the qth survey round for the time point t is given 
below:
where i
pn is the probability given by the i
th
respondent to the nth interval of density forecast, 
and un and l
n are the upper and lower bounds of the 
nth interval, respectively. The aggregate measure of 
uncertainty is then calculated as the average of 
all the individual respondents’ variances. Since this 
measure is based on an average of individual variance, 
any outlier among the individual variances can have 
outsized effects on the measure of uncertainty. 
Recently, this measure has also been applied to 
measure uncertainty in the survey of professional 
forecasters, conducted by the European Central Bank 
(Abel, et. al. 2016).
The measure of disagreement is based on the 
variability in the point forecasts of the individual 
forecasters for growth and inflation in the qth round 
of the SPF at the time point t.
The disagreement measures for GVA growth have 
remained mostly below its medium term average for 
all the forecast horizons in recent period (Chart 1).
In the case of CPI headline inflation, for onequarter ahead forecast horizon, disagreement has 
declined in the recent period and remained below 
its average level of 0.4 (Chart 2). For the remaining 
forecast horizons, disagreement measures remained 
largely below the respective average values in the last 
few quarters.

In case of exclusion based CPI inflation, the 
disagreement in one-quarter ahead forecasts remained 
mostly below the average level, except for few quarters 
in the recent period, where sudden spikes were 
observed (Chart 3).
Inflation uncertainty measures for the quarterly 
forecasts declined for the first two quarters of 2019-20 
since the November 2018 round (55th round) (Chart 4, 
left panel). In case of real GDP growth for 2019-20, 
uncertainty remained almost stable since the May

2019 round (58th round), while for 2020-21, uncertainty 
witnessed an uptick in the last round of the survey. 
VI. Conclusion
Professional forecasters regularly monitor 
evolving macro-economic conditions and their 
expectations provide valuable input in forming the 
near-term and medium-term economic outlook. In the 
Reserve Bank’s regular survey, forecasters revised down 
their growth and inflation projections in successive 
survey rounds in the recent period. Forecasts of both 
output growth and inflation for 2018-19 and 2019-20 
have been revised down. For the exclusion based CPI 
inflation, the forecast path was gradually revised up 
for 2018-19 but was lowered for 2019-20. 
Though the forecasters have revised both headline 
CPI inflation and exclusion based CPI inflation, the 
magnitude of forecast errors were of lower order in 
case of latter, reflecting relatively stable nature of 
exclusion based CPI inflation. The downward revisions 
in exclusion based CPI inflation forecaster for 2019-20 
were in consonance with the downward revisions in 
growth forecasts. 
For 2018-19, the forecasts for CPI headline 
inflation and GDP growth had positive bias. Also, the 
disagreement on inflation forecasts has reduced in 
the recent period, coinciding with the moderation 
in the inflation volatility, particularly after 2017. 
Empirical analysis shows that the forecasts were 
generally efficient in terms of incorporating available 
information and there has been more agreement on 
growth and headline inflation outlook among the 
forecasters in the recent period. Further, the accuracy 
of forecasts improved as the forecast horizon narrowed.
