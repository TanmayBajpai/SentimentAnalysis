State of the Economy*
The Indian economy continues to wrestle with the second 
wave of the pandemic, though cautious optimism is 
returning. By current assessment, the second wave’s toll 
is mainly in terms of the hit to domestic demand. On the 
brighter side, several aspects of aggregate supply conditions 
- agriculture and contactless services are holding up, while 
industrial production and exports have surged amidst 
pandemic protocols. Going forward, the speed and scale of 
vaccination will shape the path of recovery. The economy 
has the resilience and the fundamentals to bounce back 
from the pandemic and unshackle itself from pre-existing 
cyclical and structural hindrances.
Signs of the ebbing of the second wave of the 
pandemic are cautiously becoming evident. In fact, 
the data suggest that the second wave is rolling back 
almost as fast as it rolled in. On June 14, 2021 India’s 
daily cases fell to a seventh of their peak of 4,14,188 
a month ago (May 6). The seven-day average, which 
smooths out daily fluctuations, also declined by a 
fifth from its peak of close to 4 lakhs. This is also 
reflected in the doubling rate1
, which increased to 247 
days from its trough of 34 days at the end of April 
(Chart 1). The daily positivity rate2
, which had peaked 
at 22.7 per cent in early May, plummeted to 3.8 
per cent, remaining below 10 per cent for the 14th
consecutive day, and dipping even lower than the 
first wave’s peak of 11.7 per cent at end-August 2020. 
Recoveries outnumbered fresh cases for the 36th day, 
taking the total number of recoveries in India past 2.8 
crore. This fortuitous configuration also prevails in 7 
of the 12 states that had led the national infections 
trajectory at the outbreak3
 of the second wave 
(Chart 2). Fatalities are undergoing revisions as states 
improve their reporting, but the slow pace of their 
reduction relative to infections is keeping the nation 
on edge.

Mumbai, India’s financial capital and most 
densely populated city, has been battered by both 
waves of the pandemic and has, in fact, led each 
surge. But this time, the city pulled one back and 
emerged as an example of COVID management4
(Chart 3). It is based on five pillars: ward-level COVID 
command posts equipped with ambulances, doctors, 
telephone operators and basic infrastructure – the 
disaster control room, a solitary unit set up in the 
first wave, has been decentralised into these 24 
command posts; contact tracing and medical aid sent 
to homes; integrated hospital bed management with 
maintenance of surplus medical capacity; oxygen 
management by building storage infrastructure, 
monitoring of cylinder refilling and hospital oxygen 
usage; and data-driven decision-making. 
Yet, forewarned is forearmed. Using historical 
data in mathematical and epidemiological models, 
scientists and virologists are debating predictions of a 
third wave, adding a war-room urgency to contingency 
planning. A variant detected in India, labelled ‘Delta” 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) and known 
by the scientific name B.1.617.2, is being regarded 
as highly transmissible and is categorised by it as a 
variant of concern (VOC). There is, therefore, no 
question of letting down the guard. India could see 
another wave, but it is assailable with a combination 
of social distancing, masking, ramping up of health 
infrastructure and most importantly, vaccination. In 
the context of the latter, prescient guidance on the 
way forward shines light amidst the encircling dark. 
The Ministry of Finance estimates that in order to 
achieve herd immunity and regain the momentum 
of the economic recovery, the target population to be 
vaccinated is 70 crore by September 2021 and around 
113 crore more doses are needed; accordingly, around 
93 lakh vaccinations are required per day to achieve 
the herd immunity. While the peak daily vaccination 
rate attained till date is 42.65 lakh, “doubling the 
shifts and possibly vaccinating 24x7 for a couple 
of months can enable the ambitious, but possible, 
throughput of 1 crore shots a day.” (GoI, May 20215
).

M.R. Shah observed, “The BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] 
is doing some great work... [Other civic authorities] can learn from them.”

At a global level, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) has made a proposal to defeat the pandemic: 
(1) vaccinating at least 40 percent of the population 
in all countries by the end of 2021 and at least 60 per 
cent by the first half of 2022; (2) tracking and insuring 
against downside risks; and (3) ensuring widespread 
testing and tracing, maintaining adequate stocks of 
therapeutics, and enforcing public health measures 
in places where vaccine coverage is low (Chart 4). 
The benefits of such measures at about US$ 9 trillion 
far outweigh the costs, which are estimated to be 
around US$ 50 billion – of which US$35 billion 
should be paid by grants from donors and the 
residual by national governments potentially with 
the support of concessional financing from bilateral 
and multilateral agencies. The strategy requires 
global cooperation to secure upfront financing, 
upfront vaccine donations, and at-risk investment 
to insure against downside risks for the world (IMF, 
20216
). The G7’s pledge to ‘vaccinate the world’ 
imparts traction to these calculations.
On May 31, the National Statistical Office (NSO) 
revised India’s real GDP for 2020-21, revealing a 
shallower contraction (-7.3 per cent) than earlier 
estimated, with the brighter outcome for the fourth 
quarter (January-March 2021) turning out to be the 
decisive swing factor. Private consumption emerged 
out of three successive quarters of contraction as pentup demand was released with progressive unlocking 
after the first wave. Government spending surged 
back to save the blushes – excluding it, the growth of 
1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter would have been 
reversed into a decline of 1.1 per cent and for the 
year as whole, there would have been a contraction 
of 8.5 per cent. Some of the public spending was also 
reflected in fixed capital formation. For 2021-22, the 
Reserve Bank has projected real GDP growth of 9.5 
per cent on the assumption that the impact of the 
second wave will be contained in the first quarter of 
the year in which strong base effects from last year’s 
precipitous contraction will come into play. Real GDP 
may hence grow by 18.5 per cent in the first quarter, 
slowing to 7.9 per cent in the second quarter, 7.2 
per cent in the third quarter and 6.6 per cent in the 
last quarter of the year as base effects slowly wane 
(Chart 5a). The impact of the second wave is hence

estimated at about `2 lakh crore of lost 2021-22 
output. By current assessment, the second wave’s 
toll is mainly in terms of the hit to domestic demand 
on account of regional and specific containment 
rather than a nation-wide lockdown. Moreover, this 
wave has fanned into smaller cities and villages, 
sapping rural demand. The support from government 
spending may also moderate from the extraordinary 
expansion undertaken last year. On the brighter side, 
several aspects of aggregate supply conditions such 
as agriculture and contactless services are holding 
up amidst pandemic protocols. Industrial production 
and exports have surged on strong base effects, but 
there is also evidence of positive momentum. At the 
cost of reiteration, it is vaccination which will shape 
the recovery. The economy has the resilience and 
the fundamentals to bounce back from the pandemic 
and unshackle itself from pre-existing cyclical and 
structural hindrances that have caused its trajectory 
of output to deviate from potential into a negative 
output gap since 2019-20Q4 (Chart 5b). 
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank set about crafting 
and putting in place filaments of the financial safety 
net for the economy that was alluded to in last 
month’s article, pursuing its commitment to keep 
finance flowing through a panoply of channels in 
order to ease financial conditions further. As Governor 
Shri Shaktikanta Das pointed out, 
“With the second wave intensifying this financial 
year, the focus of the Reserve Bank is increasingly 
turning from systemic liquidity to its equitable 
distribution. In fact, the enduring lesson from the 
experience of the pandemic in the Indian context 
has been the deployment of unconventional 
monetary policy measures that distribute liquidity 
among all stakeholders…We shall continue with 
our proactive and pre-emptive approach, relying 
on market-based channels of transmission as we 
strive to mitigate the toll of the pandemic and 
return the economy to a path of high and durable 
growth….We will continue to think and act out

of the box, planning for the worst and hoping 
for the best…..The need of the hour is not to 
be overwhelmed by the current situation, but to 
collectively overcome it.”
 On June 4, drawing on the decision of the 
monetary policy committee (MPC) to continue 
maintaining the policy rate at its all-time low of 
4 per cent (unchanged since May 2020) and also to 
continue with an accommodative stance as long as 
necessary, the Reserve Bank announced another 
large purchase operation in June to complete its asset 
purchase initiative G-SAP 1.0. Of the quantum of 
`40,000 crore that was announced, `10,000 crore was 
reserved for state development loans (SDLs) with a 
view to compressing their spreads over corresponding 
central government securities. This, in turn, would 
work towards improving the appetite for ultra-long 
central government securities vis-à-vis SDLs, with the 
yields of the former becoming relatively attractive for 
buy-to-hold investors. A G-SAP 2.0 of `1.2 lakh crore 
was also announced for Q2:2021-22, coinciding with 
the peaking of volume of issuances planned for the 
year. It was also stressed that open market and forex 
operations other than the G-SAPs would continue, 
having conducted such operations of `37,955 
crore already in the current financial year up to 
June 4. These measures will relieve market pressures, 
improve investor demand and help to place the 
government’s borrowing in the market at minimum 
costs and rollover risk (Chart 6). 
Expanding the financial safety net further, the 
Reserve Bank also announced a liquidity window of 
`15,000 crore to be made available on tap for fresh 
bank lending of up to 3 years tenor at the repo rate 
for services adversely impacted by the pandemic such 
as hotels and restaurants, tourism, aviation ancillary 
services and other contact-intensive services. As an 
incentive, banks can park amounts equivalent to their 
loan book under the window as fixed rate reverse 
repo with the Reserve Bank and earn 3.75 per cent 
as against the rate of 3.35 per cent offered under the 
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF). A special liquidity 
facility of `16,000 crore at the policy repo rate was 
extended to the Small Industries Development Bank 
of India (SIDBI) for on-lending to micro, small and 
medium enterprises (MSMEs), particularly smaller 
MSMEs and other businesses, including those in 
credit deficient and aspirational districts. The coverage

of Resolution Framework 2.0 announced on May 5, 
2021 for resolution of COVID-19 related stress among 
micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as 
well as non-MSME small businesses and individuals 
(for business purposes) was expanded by enhancing 
the maximum aggregate exposure threshold from 
`25 crore to `50 crore. Alongside, doing business was 
eased further by (i) allowing authorised dealer banks 
to place margins on behalf of their foreign portfolio 
investor clients for transactions in government 
securities; (ii) allowing regional rural banks to issue 
certificates of deposit (CDs) and all issuers of CDs to 
buy them back before maturity; and (iii) enabling the 
National Automated Clearing House (NACH), a bulk 
payment system that facilitates one-to-many and 
many-to-one credit transfers and collections as well 
as direct benefit transfers, to be made available on 
all days of the week. Thus, the Reserve Bank remains 
engaged in safeguarding the economy and its financial 
system, maintaining financial stability and congenial 
financing conditions for all stakeholders (Tables 1a 
and 1b).
On May 27, the Reserve Bank released its Annual 
Report for the year 2020-21. Its candid and sobering 
messages went down as unbiased and professional7
. 
In the assessment of the Reserve Bank, the pandemic 
produced a fusion of a broad-based aggregate demand 
shock and a lockdown-induced supply shock and 
delivered many lessons. It showed us how globalised 
we are, not only in our vulnerability to viral 
infections but also in the manner in which vaccines 
are produced and shared. A virtuous combination 
of public and private investment can ignite a shift 
towards investment and thereby to a trajectory of 
sustained growth. A collective global effort to fight 
the pandemic will surely bring better results than 
individual countries fighting on their own. The G20 
goal of strong, sustainable and inclusive growth may 
yet be in sight and within reach.
An aspect of the Annual Report that has raised 
considerable heat and dust in the media is the 
surplus transferred to the government. Mainly 
stemming from saving on balance sheet provisions 
and employees’ superannuation and other funds, the 
surplus constitutes just 0.44 per cent of GDP (which is

taken as a measure of seigniorage8
). In this context, it 
is worthwhile to note the findings of comprehensive 
research on central banking in developing countries 
(Fry, Goodhart and Almeida, 1996): “In flow terms, 
we can think of the central bank as the government’s 
golden goose. With an unimpaired balance sheet:
• The free-range goose conducting conservative 
monetary policy with a fair degree of 
independence produces golden eggs in the 
form of seigniorage worth 0.5 to 1 per cent of 
GDP;
• The battery farm goose, bred specially for 
intensive egg-laying, can produce golden eggs 
in the form of an inflation tax yielding 5 to 10 
per cent of GDP; 
• The force-fed goose can produce revenue of 
up to 25 per cent of GDP for a limited period 
before the inevitable demise of the goose and 
collapse of the economy.
All three forms of central bank geese have been 
sighted in recent years.”
From the point of the surplus transfer alone, 
therefore, the Reserve Bank can be characterised as 
‘free-ranging’ and conducting independent monetary 
policy, i.e., independent of fiscal dominance 
(Table 2). 
Another landmark that was quietly passed in 
early June was the level of foreign exchange reserves 
crossing US$ 600 billion. With this development, 
India is the 5th largest reserve holding country in the 
world9
, the 12th largest foreign holder of US treasury securities10 and the 10th largest in terms of gold 
reserves. While foreign exchange reserves provide 
cushions against unforeseen external shocks, levels 
are often deceptive, and a better gauge of external 
vulnerability is an assessment of specific indicators. 
In terms of projected imports for 2021-22, the current 
level of reserves provides cover for less than 15 months, 
which is lower than for other major reserve holders –

II. Global Setting
Global economic recovery is gaining traction, 
though simultaneously the multi-speed characteristic 
of the recovery is becoming stark. The state of the 
global economy is mixed, we are in a much better place 
than we thought we would be a year ago (Carstens, 
2021), but the recovery is uneven and incomplete and, 
in fact, three distinct recoveries are underway – the 
US and China with rapidly declining effects of the 
pandemic; European countries with growth prospects 
remaining favourable for 2021 despite some early 
hiccups; and emerging market economies (EMEs) with 
varied growth prospects but a relatively less positive 
overall outlook because of resurgence in infections 
and slow progress on vaccination.
In its latest Economic Outlook released on May 
31, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) has revised up the global 
growth forecast for 2021 to 5.8 per cent (Table 4). It 
cautions that the growth would significantly rely 
on policy support and public health measures. It is

estimated that world income in real terms by end2022 would be about US$3 trillion less than in a no 
pandemic scenario, with growing inequality among 
nations.
In its June 2021 Global Economic Prospects, the 
World Bank has also revised upwards its forecast of 
global growth to 5.7 per cent this year. It notes the 
recovery is led by a few major advanced economies 
(AEs), while most EMEs are far behind. By 2022, 
global GDP would be 1.8 per cent lower than the prepandemic projections. 
The global composite purchasing managers’ index 
(PMI) rose to its highest level in May 2021 in over 
fifteen years. The PMI for services was at a 181-month 
high and was higher than the manufacturing PMI for 
the second successive month (Chart 7). 
World trade is strengthening further: the latest 
reading as of May 2021 of the Global Trade Barometer 
compiled by the World Trade Organization (WTO) at 
109.7 is almost 10 points higher than the baseline of 
100 and about 22 points higher than a year ago. After 
having reached the pre-pandemic levels by end-2020, 
world trade and industrial production grew (q-o-q) by 
3.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively in Q1:2021 
(Chart 8). Shipping costs continue to spiral, the Baltic 
Dry Index surged to its highest level in more than a 
decade as supply disruptions continue to co-exist with 
the bounce back in demand.
Global economic uncertainty is on the wane 
owing to vaccine rollouts and gradual re-opening of the 
economies. This augurs well for the global economic 
environment (Chart 9).

range in the past two months, though with a firming 
bias with resurgence in demand and gradual lifting 
of travel restrictions (Chart 10b). The Bloomberg 
Commodity Index, which tracks prices of 23 raw 
materials, has been hitting decadal highs on many 
occasions in the past two months, with the latest 
being on June 10 (Chart 10c). 
In the financial markets, stock markets remained 
frothy. Most stock markets declined in the first half 
of May as infections and mortalities climbed up in 
large parts of Asia and other countries. Thereafter, 
with better economic outcomes and the gathering 
pace of vaccination, the markets have been rising 
(Chart 11a). The US S&P index scaled a fresh peak 
on June 11. Long-term US Treasury yields have 
continued to soften with occasional blips on 
uncertainty surrounding the stance of monetary 
policy and tapering of asset purchases (Chart 11b). 
Yields in other countries, including a few EMEs, have 
softened concurrently.
In the currency markets, the US dollar continued 
to dip as treasury yields softened. All the gains that 
had accrued in Q1:2021 were wiped out by end-May, 
with some claw back in June so far (up to June 11). 
The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) 
Emerging Markets currency index hit its all-time high 
in the second week of May and hit further peaks 
on ten trading days since May 25, 2021, closing at 
a high of 1755.59 on June 11, 2021 (Charts 11c and 
11d). In Q2:2021 so far (up to June 11), the sharpest 
appreciations were observed in Brazil and South Africa, 
which are commodity exporters. In an environment of 
risk-on sentiments and high commodity prices, these 
EME currencies have strengthened notwithstanding 
recent resurgence of infections in the countries 
(Chart 11e). 
According to the Institute of International Finance 
(IIF), portfolio flows to EMEs in May were only about 
one-fourth of that in April (Chart 11f). Total EME 
portfolio flows were US$ 13.8 billion in May, with 
debt flows accounting for the lion’s share just as in 
April. Excluding China, there was a net outflow from 
equities in most other EMEs in May.

While several EMEs are experiencing inflation 
at or above targets, there has been swift pick-up 
in inflation in AEs too in recent months. The US 
consumer price index (CPI) inflation in May was an 
almost 13-year high of 5.0 per cent. The Euro area 
notched up inflation of 2 per cent in May, the upper 
limit of its inflation target. Similarly, inflation is now 
in striking distance of the target in most other AEs 
barring Japan.

Iceland became the first AE central bank to raise 
rates since the pandemic’s outbreak. The central bank 
of Iceland raised its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) 
in May on inflation concerns. In June, Bank of Russia 
raised its key rate for the third consecutive time by 
a magnitude of 50 bps, with a total hike of 125 bps 
since March. 
As a significant step towards reforming the global 
tax system, the G7 group of countries agreed on June 
5, on the principle of a global minimum corporation 
tax on large firms of at least 15 per cent; paving the 
way for a broader agreement among G-20 in July. 
By ensuring that large multinationals pay tax in the 
country of actual operation, the Agreement seeks to 
disincentivise large multinationals shifting profits to 
low tax jurisdictions. The success of the deal, however, 
hinges on widespread acceptance.
Looking ahead, even as growth seems set to 
revive contingent on continued policy support and 
speedy and widespread vaccination, inflation merits 
close watching. With commodity prices rising, the 
uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, poses 
risks to the recovery and spillover risks to financial 
markets, especially those of EMEs.
III. Domestic Developments
The Indian economy continues to wrestle with 
the second wave of the pandemic, though cautious 
optimism is returning, with greater improvement 
expected by early July, as predicted by statistical/
mathematical models12. The first sign of a peak, 
coming as it did in mid-May, is in sync with these 
forecasts. 
The provisional estimates (PE) of annual national 
income by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on 
May 31 revised upward India’s real GDP growth 
by 0.7 percentage points from the second advance 
estimates to a lower contraction of 7.3 per cent in 
2020-21. The most promising print was the doubledigit growth recorded in gross fixed capital formation 
(GFCF), aided by government’s push to infrastructure 
(Chart 12). Furthermore, the saving behaviour of 
households during the second wave could throw 
some light on normalisation of consumption going 
forward (Annex Box 1).
The impact of the second wave on the economy 
was exacerbated in May 2021 with many states 
opting for localised lockdowns. These restrictions 
impeded public mobility all around as mirrored in 
the Google and Apple mobility indicators, though 
the dip in movement showed signs of bottoming 
out in the last week of May (Chart 13a and 3b). Like 
mobility indicators, electricity generation readings too 
bottomed out, with supply recovering towards the last 
week of May (Chart 13c).
12 The daily caseload could further decline to below 100,000 by 2 June 
and below 10,000 by 7 July, shows a model developed by faculty at the 
Indian Institutes of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad (SUTRA model). 
Another mathematical model, built by professors at the Indian Institute 
of Science, Bengaluru, shows the daily count could slip below 100,000 by 
26 May.

Aggregate demand conditions grappled with 
lockdown like restrictions in several parts of the 
country. GST E-way bills moderated for the second 
consecutive month in May 2021, reaching a oneyear low. Normalised to pre-pandemic February 2020 
level, E-way bills plummeted to levels last seen prior 
to June 2020. Intra-state E-way bills fared better 
than inter-state e-way bills, presumably due to interState restrictions (Chart 14). Sequentially, E-way bills

plunged by 32.0 per cent, and compared to May 2019 
they contracted by 26.3 per cent. This may indicate 
further moderation in GST collections going forward. 
GST legislation protected the revenues of states 
during the transition period of five years (2017-18 
to 2021-22) with an annual growth of 14 per cent 
per annum over the 2015-16 revenue base. Any 
shortfall was to be funded through additional tax 
(compensation cess) on sin/luxury goods. In the four 
years since GST implementation, compensation cess 
collections were sufficient for the Centre to cover 
the shortfall in GST collections of state governments 
over 2017-18 and 2018-19; however, in 2019-20 and 
2020-21 there was a gap (Chart 15)13. 
Going forward, notwithstanding the second wave, 
GST collections in 2021-22 (so far) have fared better 
than in 2020-21, infusing optimism that the revenue 
base for states will be protected with a growth rate 
of 7 per cent14, and it may result in some surplus to 
compensate for the shortfall in the previous year. The 
gross GST revenue collected in the month of May 2021 
was `1,02,709 crore, which is 65 per cent higher than 
the GST revenues in the same month last year.
Provisional accounts (PA) of the Union Government 
for 2020-21 place the GFD at 9.2 per cent of GDP 
as against the revised estimate (RE) of 9.5 per cent 
(Table 5). This improvement emanated from higher

13 The 44th meeting of the GST council was called on June 12, 2021 with 
the single point agenda to review the rates on COVID-19 essentials. It 
retained the GST rate for vaccines at 5 per cent and brought down the rates 
on COVID-19 essentials (masks, sanitizers, medicines, oxygen and oxygen 
generation kits, testing and diagnostic kits) from 12/18 per cent to 5 per 
cent till September 30, 2021. GST rate on ambulances was also reduced 
from 28 per cent to 12 per cent.

annum from 2019-20 levels, with the Centre invoking force majeure due 
to the pandemic.

receipts, led by gross tax revenue at `20.2 lakh crore, 
partially offset by higher revenue expenditure, 
primarily on account of on-budgeting of subsidies. 
As a proactive move, instead of the original plan to 
clear out Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) debt to the 
National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) phase-wise over 
a few years, all outstanding dues were cleared in one 
swoop in March 2021.
The total fiscal slippage during the year from 
Budget Estimates (BE) to PA amounts to 568 basis 
points (bps), of which 280 bps is from shortfall in 
receipts, 238 bps due to excess expenditure (including 
208 bps because of higher food subsidy) and 49 bps 
due to the denominator effect of lower GDP vis-à-vis
BE (Chart 16). 
Going forward, the settlement of all FCI dues to 
NSSF in 2020-21 itself and the higher surplus transfer 
by the Reserve Bank will open up additional fiscal 
space of around 45-50 bps in 2021-22. 
As per the recent round of the quarterly survey 
of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce 
and Industry (FICCI), business confidence of Indian 
companies slumped during May to its lowest level 
in the last three quarters after hitting a decadal 
high in the previous round of the survey (Mint, 
June 1). Consumer goods companies are witnessing 
a slowdown in discretionary purchases such as large 
appliances, apparel and beauty products in the June 
quarter (Mint, May 18). 
Retail sales of motor vehicles plunged by 55.0 
per cent in May 2021 over April 2021, with transport 
vehicles declining by 68.1 per cent and non-transport 
vehicles by 54.0 per cent, as per Vahan Dashboard. 
Contraction in registrations was recorded across all 
major states (Chart 17). With the second wave making 
inroads into villages and small towns, rural demand 
has also taken a hit, as indicated by moderation in 
sales of tractor, two-wheeler, motorcycle and threewheeler vehicles (Chart 18).
A silver lining is that the Indian Railways loaded 
114 million tonnes of freight in May, the highest ever 
handled for this month and 2 per cent higher than 
a month ago15. Railway freight revenue remained 
robust, registering sequential growth by 2.9 per cent,

When compared to May 2019 also, exports have 
grown in May 2021. The major sectors that have 
grown as compared to May 2019 include engineering 
goods, petroleum products, iron ore, cotton textiles 
and drugs and pharmaceuticals (Chart 24).
Engineering goods, accounting for nearly onefourth of India’s total exports, were massively 
impacted due to demand / supply disruptions caused 
by the pandemic. This segment has bounced back, 
staging a smart recovery in recent months, surpassing 
pre-pandemic levels (Chart 25).

a ten-month low in May 2021. With a reading of 
50.8, however, it still remained in expansion zone 
even after marking a steep decline from 55.5 a

sub-indices of new orders and output, as headwinds 
of the second wave brought demand to a virtual 
standstill (Chart 30). The services PMI in May 
2021 contracted for the first time in eight months 
registering a value of 46.4. Contraction in exports 
and new businesses were the major reasons for the 
decline in services, mainly due to COVID related

Inflation
In May 202118, CPI inflation printed at 6.3 per 
cent, registered an increase of 2.1 percentage points 
over 4.2 per cent in April 2021 (Chart 33a). A large 
positive price momentum (month-on-month change 
in prices in the current month) cutting across food, 
fuel and core categories, along with an unfavourable 
base effect (month-on-month change in prices a year 
ago) brought about the jump in headline inflation.
Among CPI groups, CPI food and beverages 
inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in May, an increase 
by 2.6 percentage points over April. Inflation in eggs, 
milk, oils and fats, fruits, pulses, spices and prepared 
meals edged up in May while deflation in vegetables, 
cereals and sugar ebbed. In the food sub-groups, only 
meat and fish registered a softening of inflation. The 
contribution of food (with a weight of 45.9 per cent in 
the CPI) to overall inflation increased to 39 per cent in 
May from 29 per cent in April (Chart 33b). Fuel inflation 
rose sharply into double digits – by 3.6 percentage 
points – to 11.6 per cent in May. CPI excluding food 
and fuel inflation surged to 6.6 per cent in May, the 
highest print since May 2014. All core sub-groups 
registered a pick-up in inflation, with substantial 
increases in clothing and footwear, household goods 
and services, transport and communication, recreation 
and amusement, and personal care and effects.

CPI-WPI Inflation Divergence in the Recent Period
In the post-lockdown period, CPI and wholesale 
price index (WPI) inflation rates have been exhibiting 
considerable divergence. By May 2021, WPI inflation 
was at 12.9 per cent, exceeding CPI inflation by 6.6 
percentage points. This has raised concerns about 
likely spill overs to retail inflation, especially to the 
core. Episodes of such large divergences are often 
exclusively caused by prices of basic and intermediate 
commodities and industrial products, which are not 
included in the CPI, but form a sizeable share of 
the WPI (Das and George, 201719). These are largely 
internationally traded, with domestic prices closely 
linked to global commodity price cycles. During AprilJuly 2020, a collapse in international commodity 
prices caused the WPI to register sustained deflation; 
subsequently, with a sharp pick-up in commodity 
prices since H2:2020-21, the WPI registered doubledigit inflation by April-May 2021. 
Using a time-varying parameter regression, the 
long-run coefficient of WPI inflation (y-o-y) on CPI 
inflation (y-o-y) for the period April 2012 to May 2021 
is estimated to have declined from 0.57 in November 
2013 to 0.14 in May 2021 (Chart 35). 
Estimates of the time-varying volatility in 
international commodity prices when juxtaposed 
with the CPI-WPI coefficient show a strong inverse 
relationship between two, with a correlation 
coefficient of (-) 0.7920 (Chart 36). 
This indicates that rising volatility in international 
commodity prices over the last decade has resulted in 
the weakening of the long-run relationship between 
CPI and WPI inflation.

IV. Financial Conditions
The Reserve Bank acted proactively to steer 
congenial financial conditions in the system by 
ensuring that systemic liquidity stays in abundance. 
A second round of purchases under the Government 
Securities Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) 1.0 was 
undertaken on May 20, 2021 amounting to `35,000 
crore. It evoked a heartening response as mirrored in 
a bid-cover ratio of 3.5. Another round of purchases 
under G-SAP 1.0 amounting to `40,000 crore shall 
be conducted on June 17, of which `10,000 crore 
will constitute state development loans (SDLs). The 
Reserve Bank also announced G-SAP 2.0 on June 4, 
2021 – the purchase of government securities from 
the secondary market worth `1.2 lakh crore during 
Q2:2021-22. 
The average daily net absorption widened again 
to `5.0 lakh crore during June 2021 (up to June 14), 
aided by capital inflows. Amongst other autonomous 
drivers of liquidity, currency in circulation expanded 
by `1.2 lakh crore in 2021-22 so far (up to June 4) with 
heightened precautionary demand for cash amidst 
the second wave of the pandemic, which also drained 
liquidity from the banking system. Cumulatively, 
however, leakages through autonomous drivers were 
more than offset by liquidity infusing operations 
through OMOs and forex purchases conducted by the 
Reserve Bank. As a result, liquidity absorbed through 
reverse repo (both fixed and variable rate) operations 
averaged `5.5 lakh crore during May 2021 and `5.8 
lakh crore in June (up to June 14) (Chart 37).
Overnight rates in the uncollateralised segment 
drifted towards the reverse repo rate during May 2021. 
The weighted average call rate (WACR), the tri-party 
repo and the market repo rate stayed at sub-reverse 
repo rate levels, trailing by 16 bps, 9 bps and 6 bps in 
May 2021 (Chart 38). These rates traded even lower 
by 24 bps, 12 bps and 6 bps, respectively, in June (up 
to June 14) as systemic liquidity expanded. The term 
money market rates, i.e., the 3-month T-bill rate and 
3-month certificates of deposit (CD) rates firmed up 
by 9 bps and 11 bps, respectively during May 2021 
from end-April levels and traded around same levels 
in June 2021 (up to June 14).
Overall monetary/credit conditions stayed 
accommodative in support of the economic recovery.

Across bank groups, the maximum cut in term deposit 
rates occurred in respect of foreign banks, followed 
by private banks. Public sector banks, which face stiff 
competition from alternative saving instruments like 
small savings, allowed more moderate transmission 
to term deposit rates (Table 7). The interest rates on 
small saving instruments (SSIs), which are higher than 
the requisite formula-based rates,21 will be reviewed 
on June 30, 2021. 
In the fixed income segment, the yield on 10-
year G-sec traded close to the 6 per cent level in the 
second fortnight of May 2021 and early June 2021 
(Chart 40). The benign CPI inflation print for April 
2021, the confidence-inducing impact of G-SAP 1.0 
auctions and softening US treasury yields engendered 
the downward bias in yields. Towards the end of 
May, however, concerns over excess supply following 
reports of additional government borrowing to the 
tune of `1.58 lakh crore soured market sentiment, 
pushing the 10-year G-sec yield above 6 per cent. 
Subsequently, market stayed in a narrow range, 
guided by cues from announcement of another round 
of purchases under G-SAP 1.0 coupled with G-SAP 2.0 
for Q2:2021-22 amidst softened momentum in US 
treasury yields. In the primary market, four auctions 
were conducted in the second half of May and first 
fortnight of June, which took the gross borrowings 
by the central government to `2.71 lakh crore, thus 
completing nearly 37 per cent of `7.24 lakh crore 
scheduled for H1:2021-22.

Corporate bond yields eased further during 
May 2021 across ratings and issuers catergories, led 
mainly by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) 
and corporates (Annex Table A1). Even though the 
policy repo rate has remained unchanged, a slew of 
conventional and unconventional policy measures 
fostered congenial financial conditions and lowered 
the risk premia on corporate bonds. 
Indian equity markets commenced May 2021 
on a bearish note but gained strength on the back 
of liquidity enhancing measures announced by the 
Reserve Bank and resumption of portfolio flows 
(Chart 41). Indian equities were further boosted by 
the steady decline in COVID-19 caseloads, sustained 
rise in recoveries and vaccinations. Reflecting these 
positive developments, the BSE Sensex rebounded by 
6.5 per cent during May 2021 to close at 51,937.
Buoyed by prospects of relaxation of containment 
measures, the domestic equity markets extended its 
gaining streak into June 2021, with the BSE Sensex 
increasing further by 1.2 per cent to close at 52,552 
on June 14, 2021. Amid risk-on sentiment, gains were 
recorded in the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices, 
which increased by 4.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent, 
respectively, in June 2021 so far.
Reflecting the increase in preferences for holding 
overseas securities, net resource mobilisation by fund 
of funds (FoFs) investing overseas – an open ended 
mutual fund scheme with minimum 95 per cent of 
total assets invested in the overseas fund – increased 
to `10,850 crore in 12 months ended May 2021 from 
`1,006 crore in 12 months ended May 2020. 
In May 2021, net foreign portfolio investors (FPI) 
inflows were to the tune of US$ 0.9 billion. FPIs made 
net purchases in the equity segment to the tune of 
US$ 3.1 billion between May 18 and June 10, 2021, 
coinciding with the drop in the number of COVID-19 
cases in India. Higher FPI activity in the equity market 
reflects their rising confidence about an impending 
recovery in the economy, alleviating earlier concerns 
of investors on corporate earnings (Chart 42). 
Foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time 
high of US$ 605.0 billion on June 4, 2021 (Chart 43).

V. Conclusion
Vaccines will not end the pandemic by 
themselves, notwithstanding their being perhaps the 
greatest scientific achievements in recent history. We 
have to learn to live with the virus, complementing 
vaccines with ramping up investment in healthcare, 
logistics and research. The pandemic is a real 
shock with real consequences. Hence, there is a 
need to ensure that the recovery is built on a solid 
foundation of business investment and productivity 
growth. Life- and work-style transformation such as 
increased remote work and online shopping may 
likely endure. When patterns of demand shift, some 
firms may face closure. Some industries may become 
permanently smaller. At the same time, existing 
firms in industries experiencing increased demand 
may expand and new ones will emerge. What matters 
is that resources are put to their best use and that 
reallocation occurs smoothly and with as few costs 
as possible (Carstens, 2021)22. An influential view 
identifies three sectors with the greatest growth 
potential in the post-recovery decade (Spence, 
2021)23: digital technologies; biomedical science 
(along with its applications in health care); and 
technologies that address the various challenges to 
sustainability, especially those pertaining to climate 
change. As Winston Churchill remarked, a pessimist 
sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist 
sees the opportunity in every difficulty.24
Inflation talk is driving a taut tension through 
the evolving discourse on the global macroeconomic 
outlook. Markets and analysts are convinced that 
inflation is rising into the long-term and will force 
the hand of monetary authorities to abandon ultraaccommodation. Central banks see the surge in 
inflation as transitory and talk down speculation about 
dialling back their easy policy stance. Frictions flare 
with every incoming data. In the latest development, 
however, US CPI inflation rose 5 per cent in May, 
the highest in nearly 13 years. Paradoxically, it was 
met by a global rally in bond prices that took the US 
benchmark 10-year yield to 1.48 per cent, its lowest 
level since March 2021, and lifted other government 
bond markets around the world in its tide. Has the 
market’s anxiety about inflation begun to subside, and 
is it veering to the other side of the debate? Marketbased inflation expectations - 10-year break-evens - are 
on the decline.
Analysts argue that the rise in inflation might 
be both modest and temporary, but in their view, 
several central banks have locked themselves into 
responding too slowly - “outcome-based” as opposed 
to “forecast-based” policy will inevitably result in 
an over-reaction, given the lags between policy 
and outcomes, as was seen in the 1970s with the

brutal Volcker disinflation that followed. A severe 
monetary tightening now will be devastating (Wolf, 
202125). Underlying this impasse, analysts see the 
large monetary and fiscal stimulus as out of all 
proportion to the gap between aggregate demand 
and potential supply. They also point to the fact 
that their inflation mandates are being weakened 
by diversions like climate change (King, 2021)26. It 
is pointed out that indications of market froth are 
multiplying and more warnings about input cost 
pressures on rising commodity prices are being 
sounded than before. While the surge in inflation 
may have a lot to do with pandemic base effects, it 
is also fuelled by years of underinvestment having 
made the supply response less dynamic, exacerbated 
by supply chain bottlenecks. In this situation, 
monetary policy is hostage to its own stance and 
loose financial conditions that it creates will cause 
excessive risk taking in markets even as inflation 
migrates upwards. Ultimately, monetary brakes will 
have to be slammed from behind the curve and what 
could have been a long, inclusive recovery will be 
undermined (El Erian, 2021)27.
In contrast, central banks have reiterated time 
and again that the current bout of price rises is 
temporary, and it will not push them to an early 
unwind of monetary stimulus. They pledge to 
unwaveringly stay the course of keeping policy ultraaccommodative until the goal of a durable recovery 
that embraces all is achieved. The ECB believes that 
some of the bottlenecks which have led to higher 
inflation will gradually fade out because it is a matter 
of supply response (Lagarde, 2021)28. It is pointed 
out that there is still significant economic slack, and 
that will only be absorbed gradually. With monetary

policy strategy catering to medium-term concerns, it 
means that short-term fluctuations should be looked 
through (Schnabel, 2021)29. In the US, market-implied 
inflation expectations have risen only to the levels 
that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation 
never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most 
survey measures are sending similar signals (Quarles, 
2021)30. Furthermore, the latest round of stimulus 
seems to be supporting spending and growth without 
causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation 
expectations. 
In India, the monetary policy committee of the 
Reserve Bank has recently weighed in on the debate. 
In its June 4 resolution, it saw the inflation trajectory 
in India being shaped by both upside and downside 
risks. In its view, rising international commodity 
prices, especially of crude, logistics costs, excise 
duties, cesses and taxes pose upside risks to the 
inflation outlook. On the other hand, expectations 
of a normal south-west monsoon, recent supply side 
interventions in the pulses market and further supply 
side measures to cool pulses and edible oil prices, 
and easing of containment measures with declining 
infections are seen as forces that would mitigate cost 
pressures and inflation going forward. Weak demand 
conditions may also temper the pass-through to core 
inflation. Accordingly, the MPC projected CPI inflation 
in 2021-22 in the upper reaches but within the 
tolerance band at a little above 5 per cent with risks 
broadly balanced (Chart 45).

Economy continues to evoke diverse views. Some have

Annex Box 1: COVID-19 and Household Financial Savings 
There is a perception that the COVID-19 pandemic seems 
to have altered consumer/household’s consumption 
and saving behaviour amidst heightened uncertainty on 
income streams. Both the permanent income hypothesis 
(PIH) and life cycle models (LCM) emphasise consumption 
smoothing of households over a period of time. While LCM 
shows how savings could be used to transfer purchasing 
power from one phase of life to another, consumption 
depends on both income and wealth. Households/
consumers react in two ways to income volatility. In the 
case of temporary income shocks, households smooth 
consumption through borrowing, they tend to protect 
their wealth in the case of permanent income shocks. 
Friedman’s PIH also recognises the role of permanent 
income and shocks in the form of negative/positive 
transitory income.
Amidst high uncertainty of income, precautionary savings 
tend to rise with decline in discretionary spending, as 
reflected in the private final consumption expenditure 
data on India during the pandemic period. According to 
preliminary estimates by the Reserve Bank, the household 
financial savings in Q3:2020-21 have come down to 8.233
per cent of GDP from 21 per cent and 10.4 per cent in the 
previous two quarters. 
Households’ Savings in Liquid Mutual Funds and Gold 
ETFs
The savings of high net-worth individuals (HNIs) and 
retail individuals in liquid funds34 surged sharply in 
Q1:2020-21 – mirroring the impact of uncertainty 
amidst COVID-19 induced lockdown (Chart 1a and 1b). 
Households also parked their funds in gold exchangetraded funds (ETFs). Since then, HNIs’ investments in 
liquid funds has been negative (implying a drawdown), 
but retail individuals continue to park their savings in 
liquid funds. HNIs’ and retail individuals’ investments 
in gold ETFs have been positive since June 2020. 
Households’ savings in liquid mutual funds and gold 
ETFs taken together rose in Q1:2020-21, followed by 
drawdowns in next two quarters, before an upturn again in 
Q4:2020-21. 
Bank deposits35 – with a share of around 55 per cent in 
total assets of households - decelerated by 0.1 per cent 
at end-April 2021 on a m-o-m basis as against a growth of 
1.1 per cent in April 2020; while bank advances – with a 
share of 79 per cent in total liabilities - contracted by 0.8 
per cent as against (-) 0.9 per cent in the previous year. 
The rate of decline in bank deposits vis-a-vis bank credit 
has also been higher, indicating that this time around

the banking sector component of household savings 
declined in sharp contrast with the spike in savings 
witnessed during the first wave. Additionally, currency 
holding with public has also decelerated significantly 
to 1.7 per cent during April 2021 in comparison to the 
growth of 3.5 per cent a year ago, implying heavy outgo 
towards COVID induced medical expenditure (Chart 2). 
The average 1-year pre-tax return on liquid funds 
for period ended April 2021 is higher than the 
savings deposit rate as of June 04, 2021 (Chart 3). 
Further, tax liabilities on returns earned by longterm holders of liquid funds (beyond three years) 
turn out to be lower for individuals, particularly 
those in high income slabs, in comparison to holders of 
bank deposits. Therefore, in a scenario of low interest 
rates, varied expectations of returns on different 
instruments may be altering the savings preferences of 
some households.
