1 SUTRA is a mathematical model of forecast for pandemics, authored by M Agrawal (IIT Kanpur), M Kanitkar (Integrated Defense Staff), and M Vidyasagar 
(IIT Hyderabad). The prediction is as of July 7, 2021.
State of the Economy*
The tapering of the second wave, coupled with an 
aggressive vaccination push, has brightened near-term 
prospects for the Indian economy. While several high 
frequency indicators of activity are recovering, a solid 
increase in aggregate demand is yet to take shape. On the 
supply side, agricultural conditions are turning buoyant 
with the revival in the monsoon, but the recovery of 
manufacturing and services sectors has been interrupted 
by the second wave. A pick-up in inflation is driven largely 
by adverse supply shocks and sector-specific demand-supply 
mismatches caused by the pandemic. These factors should 
ease over the year as supply side measures take effect.
Introduction
The tide is coming in again, lapping at boats 
stranded by the second wave of the pandemic. By July 
12, 2021, the number of daily confirmed infections in 
India had fallen to less than a tenth of its May 6 peak 
(4,14,000) (Chart 1a). According to the SUTRA1 model 
forecasts, the 7-day average of new cases may come 
down to 5133 by the end of August 2021. In SUTRA’s 
analysis of the third wave in an optimistic scenario, 
life goes back to normal by August, and there is no new 
mutant. In an intermediate scenario, it is assumed that 
vaccination is 20 per cent less effective. There is not 
much difference between optimistic and intermediate 
scenarios, suggesting that vaccine efficacy changes 
do not have a significant impact. In its pessimistic 
scenario, which assumes that a new 25 per cent more 
infectious virus other than Delta+ spreads in August, 
there is a bigger impact. If there is no such mutant, the 
third wave will be a ripple and comparable to the first. 
If there is an immunity-escape mutant, however, all 
the above scenarios will be invalid (Chart 1b).

The vaccination drive is gathering speed and 
breadth – from July, vaccine manufacture is being 
ramped up, on course to inoculating 40 per cent of 
the adult population by August and the entire adult 
population by end-December this year (Chart 2). 
People are stepping out of isolation as containment 
measures are being cautiously eased. As the section 
on domestic developments points out, mobility 
is rising and workplaces are closing on to normal 
attendance. This is corroborated by the jump in 
advance tax payments in June, and in e-way bills. 
Power consumption is recovering from a soft patch. 
Freight transported by the Indian Railways has shown 
pandemic-proofing, having maintained a rising profile 
through the second wave’s visitation. All payment 
modes – cash withdrawals at teller machines; cards; 
unified payments interface; net banking; physical 
points of sale; and electronic funds transfer – have 
registered an uptick in volumes in June, forerunner 
to a revival of business and consumer confidence. 
Tailwinds for digital transactions are strong, benefiting 
from the infrastructure built up over the last 12 
months. Taking these developments into account, the 
27-indicator economic activity index (EAI) estimates 
that real GDP will register a growth of 22.1 per cent in 
April-June 2021 (Kumar, 20202
). 
The virus is retreating to malevolently mutate 
unseen, offering a brief window of respite. This 
opportunity must be seized to (a) prepare for a 
possible third wave; and (b) renew our tryst with the 
interrupted recovery: “There is a tide in the affairs of 
men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.”3 
On June 30, the Reserve Bank released 
preliminary data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) 
for the final quarter of 2020-21, which confirmed the 
turning of the tide in the evolution of the Indian 
economy. Current account surpluses in the first half 
of the year have given way to modest deficits in the 
second half on the wings of a steady restitution of 
the demand for imports from the pandemic’s first 
wave lows. Although substantially driven by rising 
petroleum products (POL) and gold imports, the 
revival of landings of capital goods, raw materials and 
intermediates from abroad that has held up right up to 
early July 2021 is indicative of the gradual gathering of 
pace of the wheels of domestic industry. Although still 
nascent, this is an important indicator of the dynamic 
macroeconomic situation in the country. Absorptive 
capacity in the context of attracting and using capital 
flows from abroad to supplement domestic saving and 
push up the investment rate towards its potential is 
steadily improving. Being a mirror image of the saving 
investment gap in the economy, the current account 
deficit (CAD) at 1.0 per cent of GDP in Q4 corroborates 
the National Statistical Office’s (NSO) estimates of 
gross capital formation rising from its pandemic low 
of 21.9 per cent of GDP in Q1 to 31.3 per cent in Q4. In 
fact, two-thirds of net foreign capital inflows received 
by India during Q4 were absorbed domestically

rate, if sustained, will improve the outlook for India’s 
potential output and as a result, the nation’s external 
solvency. The resilience of remittances in the face 
of the pandemic also augurs well for the prospects 
for gross disposable income and hence domestic 
consumption. 
In recognition of these early signs of a turnaround, 
foreign investors have reposed confidence in 
India’s medium-term growth prospects. On June 
21, the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development’s (UNCTAD) World Investment Report 
2021 (WIR) revealed that India became the fifth largest 
recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 
the world in 2020 (Chart 3). According to the UNCTAD, 
global FDI is set to recover some lost ground in 2021, 
with the Asian region expected to be the major 
recipient. India is marked as a significant beneficiary, 
with the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme 
identified as a game changer in attracting exportoriented investments that will underpin a rebound 
of FDI into Indian manufacturing. Already, gross FDI 
inflows have amounted to US$ 32.0 billion in first five 
months of 2021 (January to May), close to 37 per cent 
of the entire inflows in 2020.

India is also becoming an attractive destination 
for foreign portfolio investments (FPI) in equities 
in 2021. On a year-to-date basis, India is the 
third largest recipient among major emerging 
market economies (EMEs) – after China and Brazil 
(Chart 4a). The domestic equity market has been one 
of the best performers globally (Chart 4b). In US dollar 
terms, India’s benchmark indices, the Sensex and 
the Nifty, offered gains of 8.3 per cent and 10.8 per 
cent, respectively, as against 6.9 per cent by the MSCI 
Emerging Markets index and 12.5 per cent by the 
MSCI World index. India accounted for 2.6 per cent of 
the world market capitalisation (m-cap) in June 2021; 
in fact, India’s m-cap rose 66 per cent in one year to 
US$ 3.02 trillion in June, outpacing the 44 per cent 
growth in the global m-cap. The market value of 
Indian equity holdings of FPIs touched a record 
US$ 610 billion by mid-June 2021, albeit moderated to 
US$ 592 billion in the second fortnight of the month, 
but still up 14.4 per cent over end-December 2020 and 
71.9 per cent from its level a year ago. The surge in 
FPI inflows coincides with the equity risk premium 
of Indian equities falling sharply from as high as 5.3 
per cent in March 2020 to 3.4 per cent in July so far 
(Chart 5a).
FPI equity valuations have risen in financial 
services, software and computer services, oil and gas, 
metals and mining, consumer durables, chemicals 
and capital goods sectors, which together account for 
64 per cent of the total increase in these valuations 
during 2021 so far (Chart 5b). 
In its first semi-annual Financial Stability Report 
(FSR) for the year 2021-22 released on July 1, the 
Reserve Bank noted that the banking system’s prepandemic capital and liquidity buffers have imparted 
resilience, with some of them accessing the market 
for fresh capital, while public sector banks have 
been allocated budgetary recapitalisation. Under this 
protective cover, banks have improved their financial 
performance and profitability. Among other financial 
intermediaries, liquidity stress has eased considerably 
among non-banking financial companies, with the 
Reserve Bank reaching out to smaller and vulnerable 
entities with targeted measures. In this milieu, the 
findings of the FSR shed light on the underlying state 
of the financial sector:

•	 Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) 
and net NPAs (NNPAs) as ratios of gross 
advances settled at 7.5 per cent and 2.4 
per cent, respectively, at the end of March 
2021; their resort to restructuring under the 
COVID-19 resolution framework was not 
significant and write-offs fell sharply year-onyear (y-o-y).
•	 The annual slippage ratio of all SCBs, 
measuring new accretions to NPAs as a share 
of standard advances at the beginning of the 
year, fell to 2.5 per cent in 2020-21 from a 
peak of 7.6 per cent in March 2018.
•	 The provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) – the 
proportion of provisions (without write-offs) 
held for NPAs to GNPA - increased from 66.2 
in March 2020 to 68.9 per cent in March 2021, 
primarily due to a decline in GNPAs.
•	 The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 
increased by 130 bps from 14.7 per cent in 
March 2020 to 16.0 per cent in March 2021.
•	 Stress tests indicate that the GNPA ratio of 
all SCBs may transition to 9.8 per cent in 
the baseline scenario by March 2022 and to 
10.36 per cent and 11.22 per cent, under a 
medium stress and a severe stress scenario, 
respectively.
•	 The system level CRAR holds up well, under 
the two stress scenarios; banks would be able 
to maintain CRARs well above the regulatory 
minimum of 9 per cent as of March 2022 even 
in the worst-case scenario (Charts 6a-6h).
Thus, several small things are coming together 
to brighten the outlook. Can India assimilate them 
and leverage a big push? To adapt from an old adage, 
today’s mighty banyan is just yesterday’s seed that 
held its ground. Against this backdrop, the rest of 
this article is structured into four parts. Section II 
presents global developments in June and July 2021 
while Section III sets out an overview of the recent 
unfolding of events in the domestic economy. Section 
IV deals with the evolution of financial conditions. 
The last section concludes the article.

II. Global Setting
The global economic recovery is getting stronger 
but remains uneven and unequal. Amidst pandexit 
challenges, rotation in demand from services to goods 
has averted a sharp drop in activity. The Euro area is 
emerging as the new growth centre, along with some 
EMEs where vaccination is fast paced, but a few large 
Asian economies are beset with renewed surges of 
infections and consequent lockdowns. In its forecast 
released on July 7, 2021, the European Commission 
estimates that global (excluding the EU) real GDP 
growth in 2021 will be 5.9 per cent (broadly unchanged 
from the May forecast) but growth in the Euro area 
and the European Union has been revised up by 0.5-
0.6 percentage points.
The global composite purchasing managers’ 
index (PMI) moderated to 56.6 in June from a 15-year 
high reached in May, with the manufacturing PMI 
softening from a 11-year high a month ago (Chart 7). 
Simultaneously, cost pressures have continued to 
escalate. 
The US economy added 8,50,000 jobs in June 2021, 
although the unemployment rate rose marginally. 
In the European Union, the number of unemployed 
people dropped by 3,82,000 in May, boosting optimism 
about a rebound in the region’s labour market. The 
Bank of Japan’s Tankan Survey Index released on July 1 
indicates that big manufacturers’ business confidence 
improved to a 2.5-year high in Q2:2021, raising hopes 
for sustained growth.

global merchandise trade accelerated sequentially in

Q2:2021, consistent with its forecast of a growth rate 
of 8.0 per cent for 2021. On the other hand, monthly 
data on global merchandise trade volumes suggest 
a slowing of momentum (Chart 8a). The Baltic Dry 
Index, a measure of transportation prices for ships 
carrying dry bulk commodities, rose to a 11-year high 
by end-June, before easing modestly in July so far 
(Chart 8b).
Gold prices, which were correcting in the first 
half of June, fell sharply after the hawkish tone of 
the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
(Chart 9a). Prices have crept back to the psychological 
level of US$1,800 per ounce in the second week of 
July. With demand continuing to outstrip supply, 
crude oil prices have risen by 46.3 per cent in 2021 (up 
to July 8), triggered by the failure of the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus to 
agree on easing supply in the remaining months of 
2021 (Chart 9b). The Bloomberg Commodity Index, 
which tracks prices of 23 raw materials, moderated 
sharply in mid-June; rising demand is, however, lifting 
commodity prices again (Chart 9c). House prices have 
scaled multi-year/decade highs in several geographies 
(Chart 9d).
In the financial markets, the FOMC’s statement 
of June 16 turned out to be a defining moment. While 
stock markets in advanced economies (AEs) saw only 
a momentary blip, equity markets in EMEs suffered 
sharp falls, which continued till a day after the release 
of FOMC meeting minutes on July 7, 2021 (Chart 10a). 
The US S&P index recovered from a plunge in the 
middle of June and rallied in a seven-session recordsetting streak that ended on July 2 (Chart 10b). It has 
continued to peak thereafter, with the latest peak hit on 
July 12. Long-term US Treasury yields edged up 
sharply, following the FOMC’s statement, but they

have ebbed and risen thereafter in accordance with 
the vagaries of data releases, closing at 1.29 per cent 
on July 8, the lowest level in more than four months. 
Thereafter, yields have settled at 1.36 per cent 
(Chart 10c). 
The slide in US Treasury yields is reverberating 
through global financial markets, propelling shares of 
fast-growing tech groups to new records and driving 
down corporate borrowing costs. Investors are suddenly 
being forced to reposition against a peak in growth, a 
peak in inflation and a peak in policy stimulus. 
Currency markets also responded to the FOMC’s 
statement, with the US dollar posting a sharp 
rise. Commensurately, the Morgan Stanley Capital 
International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Currency 
Index has moderated, after peaking on June 11

(Chart 10d). In June, while most EME currencies lost 
gains logged earlier, the Brazilian real appreciated 
sharply on the back of strong monetary tightening 
(Chart 10e). In July so far, there has been net 
depreciation overall for all BRICS currencies. 
According to the Institute of International 
Finance (IIF), the recent hawkish shift in the Fed’s 
communication affected portfolio flows to EMEs; 
nonetheless, overall flows in June turned out to be 
two and a half times higher than in May (Chart 10f). 
Total EME portfolio flows were US$ 28.1 billion, with 
debt flows continuing to account for the lion’s share. 
Inflation continues to ratchet up across the 
world. In the US, CPI inflation in June recorded largest 
monthly momentum in about 13 years and surged to 
5.4 per cent. The Fed’s preferred measures of inflation, 
the y-o-y changes in the personal consumption 
expenditure (PCE) index and PCE excluding food and 
energy, at 3.9 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, 
in May continued to be at multi-decade highs. The UK 
also saw inflation edging up above the target to 2.1 per 
cent in May and further to 2.5 per cent in June. In the 
euro area, however, inflation in June moderated to 1.9 
per cent. 
Even as the Fed and the Bank of England 
maintained status quo on the quantum of asset 
purchases in their latest meetings, the Reserve Bank 
of New Zealand has announced winding up of its Large 
Scale Asset Purchase Programme and and Centrl Banks 
of a few other AEs have given forward guidance on 
unwinding of monetary stimulus in H2:2021. While 
the summary of economic projections submitted at 
the FOMC meeting (June 15-16) signaled a tightening 
of monetary policy in the US earlier than projected in 
the March meeting, it was subsequently followed by 
a dovish statement from Chairman Powell reiterating 
the Fed’s commitment to achieving an inclusive 
recovery. 
In a move to ease money market pressure and 
to prevent negative yields from taking hold, the Fed 
increased the interest rate paid on required and 
excess reserve balances by 5 bps to 0.15 per cent, 
effective June 17, 2021. It also hiked the offering rate 
on overnight reverse repo program (ON RRP) by 5 bps 
to 0.05 per cent. The ON RRP operations have seen 
record deposits in recent months, reaching a high of 
US$ 992 billion at end-June, which effectively amounts 
to a one-day absorption of more than 8 months of 
asset purchases under the current quantitative easing 
programme of the Fed.
On July 8, 2021, the European Central Bank (ECB) 
unveiled its new monetary policy strategy under 
which a symmetric 2 per cent inflation target has been 
adopted as against the earlier target of below but close 
to 2 per cent4
. Due to the effective lower bound on 
policy rates, there will be resort to other instruments 
such as forward guidance, asset purchases, longerterm refinancing operations and other new policy 
instruments as required. The ECB also announced a 
detailed roadmap, up to 2024, for its comprehensive 
action plan on climate change. The result of the ECB’s 
strategy review, the first since 2003, is a modest but 
welcome update, helping to make its goals clearer. 
The new target jettisons the central bank’s hawkish 
bias. This makes sense as the ECB has consistently 
undershot its inflation target since the 2008 financial 
crisis. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia has shortened the 
maturity at which it practices yield curve control, 
while also continuing bond purchases at a slower 
pace than before after the completion of the current 
tranche of quantitative easing. Among major EMEs, 
Brazil effected its third rate hike in 2021 so far of 75 
basis points (bps) in June. The Banco de México also 
raised its policy rate by 25 bps to 4.25 per cent on 
inflation concerns, after having cut rates as recently 
as in February. On the other hand, China has lowered 
4 Even as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has been 
retained as the measure of price, as a multi-year project, the Eurostat 
will lead a project to include costs related to owner-occupied housing 
in the HICP. This will help to better measure the inflation relevant for 
households. Till that is achieved, in the interim period, for monetary 
policy assessment, the ECB will also consider initial estimates of the cost 
of owner-occupied housing in conjunction with the other broader inflation 
measures.

III. Domestic Developments
The tapering of the second wave, coupled with an 
aggressive vaccination push, has brightened near-term 
prospects for the Indian economy. The total number 
of active cases has plunged below 4.3 lakhs and the 
7-day moving average of inoculations is above 37 lakhs 
(13 July 2021).
With many states lifting restrictions in recent 
weeks, the Google and Apple mobility indicators 
are set to surpass their levels recorded at this time 
last year (Chart 11a and 11b). Electricity generation 
readings, too, have recovered to levels comparable to 
the pre-pandemic year, i.e., 2019 (Chart 11c).

Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand conditions are recovering, 
spurred by unlock measures and the pace of 
vaccination. Average daily E-way bill collections 
improved substantially from June 20, 2021, reflecting 
the underlying improvement in economic activity. 
Intra-state E-way bills fared better than inter-state 
E-way bills, normalising to beyond pre-pandemic 
levels (Chart 12a). Toll collections, too, posted a 
sharp increase sequentially in June by 35.5 per cent 
in volume terms and 21.2 per cent in value terms. 
Normalised to February 2020 levels, collections 
recovered appreciably from levels last seen in October 
2020 (Chart 12b). 
Fuel consumption recorded an increase in June 
2021, although it remained below the pre-pandemic 
baseline of February 2020. While petrol and diesel 
consumption both recorded sequential improvements,

Automobile sales posted a strong turn around, 
reaching 82 per cent of sales recorded in prepandemic February 2020, with passenger vehicles 
near normalising (Chart 13b). With over 80 per 
cent of retail outlets now operational, retail sales 
registered a m-o-m spurt by 127.0 per cent in June. 
Transport vehicles hit a growth of 127.6 per cent, 
while non - transport vehicles grew by 126.9 per cent, 
sequentially, as per the Vahan registrations dashboard 
(Chart 13c). The impact of the second wave on rural 
demand abated, with motorcycle and two wheeler 
sales recording recovery in June 2021, even as three 
wheelers continued in red (Chart 13d). In the rural 
space, the tractor segment bounced back strongly 
during June, enabled by easing of restrictions and 
better monsoon prospects.

The continued upsurge in freight rates, especially 
of container freight, has become a major cause of 
global concern (Chart 20). Rates on major routes like 
China-Europe, which also serves India’s trade with 
Europe, have crossed US$ 10,000/TEU8
, more than five 
times the usual rates. 
India’s merchandise imports posted a growth 
of nearly 100 per cent y-o-y in June exceeding prepandemic level (Chart 21a and b). Non-oil non-gold 
imports have stayed above the US$25 billion mark 
for the seventh month in a row, boding well for the 
revival of domestic activity. Import growth has been 
broad-based with 28 sectors out of 30 major sectors 
expanding over a year ago.
Capital goods imports – one-third of India’s 
total imports - surpassed pre-COVID levels during 
Q1:2021-22. Interestingly, IIP-manufacturing shows 
a positive correlation (0.51) with previous month’s 
capital goods imports, implying that a pickup in IIP

Sowing for the kharif season covered 499.9 lakh 
hectares (around 46 per cent of the total acreage) by 
July 09, 2021. The progress of sowing has, however, 
been relatively muted, i.e., 10.4 per cent lower than 
a year ago on account of inroads of the second wave 
into rural areas, hot weather leading to power slack 
and break in the monsoon’s progress. As of July 12, 
the cumulative rainfall in this season was 7 per cent 
below the long period average (LPA) as against 13 per 
cent above a year ago (Table 3). This is also reflected 
in fertiliser sales which remained subdued till May 
(Chart 23 a and b). 
The major kharif crops like rice and sugarcane are 
less dependent on rains, with 60 per cent and 95 per 
cent of the total area under these crops, respectively, 
irrigated. On the other hand, crops like pulses, coarse 
cereals and oilseeds are largely rain-fed (Chart 24). 
Storage in water reservoirs is comfortable at 31 per 
cent of the capacity as against the decadal average of 
25 per cent. With record procurement of cereals, the 
public stocks are 3.7 and 8.1 times the buffer norms 
for rice and wheat, respectively.

Inflation
The NSO’s July 12 data release showed that 
headline CPI inflation printed at 6.3 per cent in June 
2021, unchanged sequentially after the surge of 2.1 
percentage points in May (Chart 26a). A positive price 
momentum (month-on-month change in prices in 
the current month) of around 60 bps from food and 
fuel was completely offset by a favourable base effect 
(month-on-month change in prices a year ago) of 60 
bps, keeping headline inflation unchanged.
Among CPI groups, CPI food and beverages 
inflation increased to 5.6 per cent in June from 5.2 
per cent in May. An uptick in inflation in eggs, milk, 
oils and fats, pulses and prepared meals, a lower rate 
of deflation in vegetables prices and the movement of 
sugar prices out of deflation contributed to this pickChart 25: Purchasing Managers’ Index

up. On the other hand, cereals prices moved further 
into deflation and inflation in meat and fish and spices 
softened substantially. 
Fuel inflation surged to a record 12.7 per cent 
in June from 11.9 per cent in May, driven by LPG, 
kerosene, firewood and chips and dung-cake and 
impacting both urban and rural consumers. Fuel 
(weight of 6.84 per cent in the CPI) contributed around 
13 per cent of headline inflation in June (Chart 26b). 
CPI inflation excluding food and fuel or core 
inflation softened by around 50 bps to 6.1 per cent 
in June from 6.6 per cent in May, benefiting from a 
near zero month-on-month price momentum and 
favourable base effects. Among its sub-groups, pan, 
tobacco and intoxicants registered a sharp fall in 
inflation as the impact of the one-off tax increases a year 
ago waned off. Inflation in housing, health, transport 
and communication, recreation and amusement, and 
personal care and effects also softened. On the other 
hand, a substantial pick-up in inflation was observed 
in clothing and footwear, household goods and 
services, and education. 
High frequency food price data from the Ministry 
of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution 
(Department of Consumer Affairs) indicate that cereals 
prices remained steady in the first half of July. Prices 
of pulses declined further in July as have edible oils 
prices, albeit at still elevated levels, for the first time 
since early 2020. Among the key vegetables, prices of 
potatoes, onions and tomatoes are seeing the usual 
seasonal pick-up in prices; however, on a y-o-y basis, 
prices of potatoes and tomatoes are substantially lower 
(Chart 27).

kerosene and LPG prices have also registered increases 
in July so far (Table 4).
Input costs, as reflected in the PMIs, registered 
increases in June across manufacturing and services, 
but the rate of increase in costs moderated. Selling 
prices for manufacturing and services also registered 
increases in June though the extent of pass-through of 
input costs was muted. 
IV. Financial Conditions
Amidst pandemic-stressed times, the Reserve 
Bank has been striving to soothe financial market 
sentiment by steering both systemic and sectorspecific liquidity and financial conditions in a manner 
consistent with its monetary policy stance. In its June 
4, 2021 bi-monthly meeting, the Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) kept the policy rate unchanged at 4 
per cent and persevered with the stance of remaining 
accommodative as long as necessary to revive and 
sustain growth on a durable basis. In pursuance of this 
stance, the Reserve Bank announced a special liquidity 
facility for the Small Industries Development Bank 
of India (SIDBI) to meet the funding requirements 
of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), an 
on-tap liquidity window for contact-intensive sectors, 
and enhanced exposure thresholds (from `25 crore 
to `50 crore) under the MSME resolution scheme. 
Accordingly, financial conditions eased in June relative 
to preceding months (Chart 28). 
Various indicators of monetary, liquidity and 
credit conditions also confirm the easing of financial 
conditions (Table 5). 
Surplus liquidity conditions prevailed in the 
system, with daily net absorption under the liquidity 
adjustment facility (LAF) averaging `4.86 lakh crore 
through June 2021 and `5.90 lakh crore during July 
(up to July 12) up from `4.69 lakh crore a month ago 
(Chart 29). On June 17, the Reserve Bank injected 
system-level liquidity through the third tranche 
of purchases under the Government Securities 
Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) 1.0 amounting to 
`40,000 crore. The Reserve Bank also conducted

3-month certificates of deposit (CD) rates and 3-month 
commercial paper (NBFC) rates firmed up by 20 bps 
and 15 bps, respectively, during June-July 2021 (up to 
July 12) on inflation concerns. On the other hand, the 
3-month T-bill rate remained largely stable (Chart 30).
Reserve money (RM) – a stylised depiction of the 
Reserve Bank’s balance sheet to reflect its ‘moneyness’ 
– expanded by 16.6 per cent on a y-o-y basis as on July 
9, 2021 (13.9 per cent a year ago), driven mainly by 
a pickup in bankers’ deposits with the Reserve Bank 
with the normalisation of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) 
cut of March 2020 (Chart 31). Furthermore, growth 
in currency in circulation – the largest component 
of RM – eased to a 16-month low of 11.5 per cent 
(21.4 per cent a year ago), reflecting the easing of the 
‘dash for cash’. Money supply (M3) growth slowed to

10.1 per cent as on July 2, 2021 (12.4 per cent a year 
ago), below its decennial average (2012-21) of 10.9 
per cent. While deposit growth remained healthy at 
9.8 per cent, scheduled commercial banks’ (SCBs’) 
credit to the commercial sector recorded a growth of 
6.1 per cent (6.3 per cent a year ago). Augmented by 
banks’ investments in statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) 
and non-SLR securities, the flow of banks’ funds to 
the economy expanded by 6.8 per cent (9.7 per cent a 
year ago). 
The pass-through of policy rate changes 
to lending and deposit rates of SCBs has been 
improving since March 2020. The 1-year median 
marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) 
softened cumulatively by 100 bps through March 
2020 to June 2021, while the median term deposit 
rate on fresh deposits across all tenors moderated 
by 149 bps (Chart 32). The interest rate on deposits 
of maturity of up to one year declined by 174 bps 
(Chart 33). Asymmetry in monetary transmission to 
term deposit rates across bank groups is attributable 
to the composition of deposit portfolios, with foreign 
banks mainly garnering low cost and lower duration 
wholesale deposits. In contrast, public sector banks, 
which rely more on retail deposits, face competition 
from alternative instruments like small savings. The 
Government of India (GoI) reviewed interest rates on 
small saving schemes on June 30, 2021 and left them 
unchanged for Q2:2021-22 amidst a moderation in 
household financial savings.

In the financial markets, government securities 
(g-sec) yields hardened from mid-June, with repricing 
of market expectations following the headline CPI 
inflation print for May 2021 breaching the upper 
tolerance band around the target. The 2 year and 5 
year overnight index swap (OIS) rates, which measure 
interest rate expectations, surged by 21-20 basis 
points during June-July 2021 (upto July 12) (Chart 34). 
Concomitantly, the yields on government securities 
traded higher across the curve (Chart 35). The previous 
10-year benchmark (5.85 GS 2030) hardened by 17 
bps during July 2021 (upto July 12), taking cues from 
surging crude oil prices. 
Trading volumes for the 10 year security in 
the secondary market segment remained subdued 
during June 2021 in anticipation of a new 10 year 
announcement (Chart 36). In the primary market, 
gross borrowings by the central government thus far 
(up to July 9) at `3.8 lakh crore amounted to 52 per 
cent of the scheduled borrowing of `7.24 lakh crore 
for H1:2021-22. With bids in primary issuances out of 
alignment with secondary market yield movements 
and the monetary policy stance, the two auctions 
conducted during the second fortnight of June 2021 
witnessed devolvement on primary dealers – 25 per 
cent of the notified amount of the 5 year benchmark 
in the June 18 auction and 97 per cent of the 
notified amount of GS 2023 in the June 25 auction. 
Furthermore, the Reserve Bank did not accept any 
bids for the 10 year benchmark security in the June 
25 auction. In the first auction in July, the auction

methodology of benchmark securities of tenors of 2 
years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 14 years and Floating 
Rate Bonds (FRBs) was changed from multiple pricebased to uniform price-based auctions.
In his monetary policy statement in October 
2020, Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das had stated that 
an orderly evolution of the yield curve is a public 
good and both market participants and the Reserve 
Bank have a shared responsibility in this regard. He 
had assured market participants that the Reserve 
Bank stands ready to conduct market operations as 
required through a variety of instruments to assuage 
these pressures. This guidance was reinforced in both 
primary and secondary market operations by auction 
cut-offs, devolvement, cancellations and exercise of 
green shoe options. 
The primary auction conducted on July 9, 2021 
saw a positive response from market participants to 
this forward guidance, especially in bids received for 
the new 10-year benchmark security (New GS 2031) 
for which the cut-off yield was set at 6.10 per cent. 
It is expected that this convergence between policy 
guidance and market expectations will set the tone for 
the orderly evolution of yields going forward.
Tracking the movements in G-sec yields, corporate 
bond yields for AAA rated borrowers firmed up across 
different tenors, with yields on bonds maturing in 3 
years, 5 years and 10 years ruling higher by 11 bps, 21 
bps and 20 bps up to July 8, respectively, since midJune, 2021 (Chart 37).
During June, equity markets in India were 
buoyed by the sustained dip in COVID-19 cases, 
pick-up in vaccination and prospects of a gradual 
unlocking of the economy amidst positive global 
cues (Chart 38). The benchmark BSE Sensex scaled 
fresh highs multiple times, crossing the 53,000 mark 
for the first time in intra-day trade on June 22, 2021. 
Markets corrected in the ensuing days, with some 
profit booking as the Fed put forth its timeline for 
interest rate hikes and revised upwards its inflation 
forecasts. In the month of July 2021, however, slack 
in some high frequency indicators and weak global 
cues may have contributed in profit-booking, with 
the Sensex closing at 52,373 on July 12, 2021.
During April-June 2021, flows into equity-oriented 
schemes were higher by 32.2 per cent y-o-y amidst 
improving risk appetite and renewed interest vis-àvis a decline of 31.3 per cent a year ago (Chart 39a). 
Premium collections by insurance companies during 
April-June 2021 were higher by 9.9 per cent y-o-y, 
driven by a surge in the non-life insurance segment 
(Chart 39b).
India’s current account recorded a surplus of 0.9 
per cent of GDP in 2020-21, as against a deficit of 0.9 
per cent a year ago. A sharp contraction in the trade 
deficit was the major driver, even as net services 
receipts, especially software, remained resilient.

Inbound remittances also improved steadily from 
Q2:2020-21, aided by better income conditions in

India’s net international investment position

in non-residents’ claims on India). A robust accretion

Conclusion 
A deadly heat wave sweeps across the northern 
hemisphere, with temperature at all-time highs in 
even the most temperate countries. Deaths by the 
hundreds are being recorded in Canada, the US, 
Central Europe and even arctic Russia. In India, where 
the monsoon had stalled till the second week of July, 
the heat is blistering – it was 31 degrees Celsius in 
Ladakh’s Nubra valley on July 1, 2021! Elsewhere, the 
temperature was pushing above 40 degrees in Delhi, 
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan11. All this is a 
grim reminder of the crisis that brews unseen – the 
climate. Consequently, as this article has been flagging 
since its March 2021 edition, climate change risks are 
redefining the mandate of central banks, especially in 
the conduct of monetary policy. In this context, the 
Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), 
which the Reserve Bank joined in April 2021, has set

out some good principles for voluntary adoption in 
order to refashion the operational design of monetary 
policy to incorporate climate change risks12 (Table 7). 
The objective is to shield central bank balance sheets 
against increasing financial risks arising from climate 
change. On July 11, 2021 the Financial Stability Board 
called for ‘globally consistent, comparable and reliable 
disclosures as well as a high quality and relevant data’ 
to support central banks’ actions13. It is important, 
however, to recognise that central banks also face 
sharp trade-offs when dealing with climate-related 
risks. On the one hand, central banks have to operate 
within their specific legal frameworks, and as publicly 
accountable institutions, they have to provide rigorous 
evidence in support of all actions they take. On the 
other hand, central bank balance sheets might already 
be exposed to climate-related risks and they may be 
forced to respond to them from behind the curve. 
In the wake of the pandemic, extreme uncertainty 
has clouded the global outlook. In response, monetary 
policy authorities have sought to impart some certainty 
by committing to a stance of ultra-accommodation into 
the future. Inflation has rocked this boat; markets are 
buzzing with static about the hand of the authorities 
being forced into reversing their stance sooner than 
they have committed to in order to prevent the 
economy from overheating. Bond yields spiked as the 
end of reflation trade seemed to be in sight. At stake 
for markets is the orderly evolution of financial prices. 
At stake for central banks is the weak economy which 
would not be able to withstand liquidity and rate 
tightening in its current state of health, and the fragile 
recovery that is being painstakingly scripted could be 
at risk. So, they have put their inflation credibility on 
the line, challenging the market’s view by renewing 
their commitment to stay accommodative or to 
undertake a very gradual, multi-year adjustment. The 
key, as in the rest of life, is to strike the right balance.

Subsequently, there has been a convergence of 
market inflation expectations in advanced economies 
with the central banks’ view that the inflation hump 
is transitory. In emerging market economies, however, 
capital flows have reversed, and currencies have 
weakened as some central banks have undertaken 
policy interest rate increases even when they regard 
inflation pressures as transitory (Table 8). 
Let us argue the counter factual: what if the central 
banks were to acquiesce to shrill cries from markets to 
respond pre-emptively to inflation pressures against 
the judgment that they are transitory? This has 
actually happened: the Fed’s June ‘pivot’ dating the 
future rate increases in response to the rising mercury 
of inflation has taken the shine off reflationary trade, 
which was betting on higher inflation as growth 
normalises with the ramping up of vaccination. Safe 
haven demand for longer dated paper has taken yields 
down substantially from recent highs. Shorter term

and steep rises in wages and house prices.

yields have reacted even more to monetary policy, 
flattening the yield curve and denting confidence in 
the reflation trade. Carry traders like a yield curve 
that is steep, capturing expectations of future policy 
rate increases, but it is sobering to remember that 
‘steepener’ bets from shorters that profit when longer 
dated bond prices fall faster than those of shorter 
dated ones have been wrong footed, leading to sharp 
losses. It takes less bad news today to create the same 
volatility!
In India, a similar dialectic is at play, except that 
the cycle of divergent expectations is yet to peak. 
Inflation ruled above the tolerance band during 
June-November 2020 and has again moved above the 
upper tolerance threshold in May and June 2021. The 
sense is that inflation will persist at these elevated 
levels for some months before easing in the third 
quarter of 2021-22 when the kharif harvest arrives in 
markets.

The economy is struggling to regain the 
momentum of recovery that had started in the second 
half of 2020-21 but was interrupted by the second 
wave. The pick-up in inflation is driven largely by 
adverse supply shocks due to disruptions caused by the 
pandemic, including increases in margins and taxes. 
There are also specific demand-supply mismatches as 
in the case of protein-rich food items, edible oils and 
pulses, which are being addressed by specific supplyside measures. But more needs to be done. Elevated 
international commodity prices, especially of crude, 
are also imparting cost-push pressures. These factors 
should ease over the year as supply side measures 
take effect. Furthermore, a solid increase in aggregate 
demand is yet to take shape. Even with a 9.5 per cent 
GDP growth in 2021-22, there will be substantial slack 
in the economy and demand pressures may take some 
more time to become evident.
