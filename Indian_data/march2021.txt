The short term (one year ahead) forecasting of 
capex based on time phasing of corporate projects 
financed by financial institutions was pioneered by 
Dr. C. Rangarajan in 1970. Under this methodology, an 
estimate of the likely level of capex that would have 
been made during the year is obtained, based on ex 
ante phasing plans furnished by the companies at the 
time of appraisal, It is ensured that each project enters 
the information set only once even if it is financed 
through more than one channel. Projects not financed 
through any of the above-mentioned channels or 
of a size lower than `100 million are not covered. 
Projects with private ownership below 51 per cent or 
undertaken by trusts, Central and State Governments, 
and educational institutions are also excluded. A caveat 
to be noted is that it is assumed that companies adhere 
to their ex ante expenditure plans. Consequently, 
there is the possibility that some ex ante intentions 
do not fructify into realised investment.
This article extends the tradition by estimating 
capex by the private corporate sector during 2017-18 
and 2018-19. In doing so, it also explores the 
relationship between envisaged capex (based on 
project plans) and the realised capex (as available in 
the national accounts). As a cross-check, envisaged 
capex is compared with actual investment reported 
under the first revised estimates of national income 
for 2017-18 that were released by the Central Statistics 
Office (CSO) on January 31, 2019. 
Exploring the investment intentions and project 
implementation plans of private companies and joint 
business sectors juxtaposed with the cost of projects sanctioned 
by banks/financial institutions and other sources, this article 
finds that envisaged capital expenditure (capex) marginally 
improved in 2018-19. It also examines the underlying 
relationship between envisaged capex and realised capex 
in the national income accounts.
Introduction
Capital expenditure of the private corporate 
sector is a key driver of the investment climate 
in the economy and an indication of the ‘animal 
spirits’ that influence entrepreneurial energies 
and business sentiment. As information 
on capex from published annual accounts of 
companies is available with a considerable time lag, 
a cross-country best practice is to generate corporate 
investment forecasts on the basis of surveys of 
investment intentions and other relevant factors such 
as capacity utilisation and demand indicators (Barnes 
and Ellis, 2005; Aurizio and Stefano, 2011; Osterholm, 
2013). 
India has also been a forerunner in this 
international experience, with surveys attempted 
since the late 1980s to assess and forecast investment 
intentions. Since 1978, the Reserve Bank of India has 
been providing an outlook on investment intentions. 
In essence, data on investment intentions are 
obtained from the financiers’ side – the banking sector

The rest of the article is structured into four 
sections. Section II addresses the projects sanctioned 
or financed during the period of review, funding 
thereof, distributional aspects in terms of regions 
and industries and growth of corporate investment. 
Section III presents private placements and foreign 
direct investment. Section IV provides a time-series 
analysis of envisaged investment. Section V concludes 
the study.
II. Projects Sanctioned / Financed
Proposals of 490 projects with a total cost of 
`1,728 billion were sanctioned by banks and FIs 
during 2017-18. In addition, ECBs/ FCCBs to the tune 
of `247 billion were contracted by 292 companies in 
that year. Furthermore, 51 companies did not avail of 
financing from banks and FIs, but raised `16 billion 
for their capex needs through domestic equity issues. 
Altogether, 833 companies made investment plans 
during 2017-18, aggregating `1,991 billion, as against 
916 companies with investment intentions totalling 
`2,028 billion in 2016-17 (Annex Tables 1-4). 
Industry-wise, chemical and chemical products 
industries accounted for 11 per cent of the total 
cost of projects in 2017-18, a significant rise over its 
quinquennial average (during 2012-13 to 2016-17) 
of 1.7 per cent. The share of the construction sector 
decreased to 5.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 12 per cent 
in 2016-17, indicating lacklustre activity in the sector. 
Within the infrastructure sector, the power sector 
continued to dominate, although its share dipped from 
2016-17 (45.4 per cent) and quinquennial average (43.8 
per cent) levels. The lower number of power sector 
projects sanctioned in 2017-18 also led to a contraction 
in its share in the total cost of projects (Chart 1 and 
Annex Table 5). 
The total cost of projects sanctioned in a year 
tends to be driven by the presence of mega projects 
which generally run over a longer span of time, as 
reflected in their phasing profile. There were 44 high 
value projects (`10 billion - `50 billion), with a share 
of 44.1 per cent in the total project cost. The size-wise 
distribution of the projects accorded financial sanction 
by banks/FIs shows a decrease (from five in 2016-17 
to three in 2017-18) in the number of mega projects 
(`50 billion and above); however, there was a marginal 
increase in their share in total project cost (from 17.4

per cent in 2016-17 to 18.6 per cent in 2017-18). The 
ticket size (average cost of project) of mega projects 
rose in 2016-17 and 2017-18 from a trough in 2015-16 
(Annex Table 6). 
The location of a project is typically selected on the 
basis of factors such as accessibility of raw materials, 
availability of skilled labour, adequate infrastructure, 
market size, and growth prospects. Over the last five 
years (2013-14 to 2017-18), 68 per cent of the projects 
were taken up in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra 
Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu 
and Madhya Pradesh (Chart 2). 
Maharashtra also accounted for the highest 
share (22.6 per cent) in terms of total cost of 
projects sanctioned by banks/FIs in 2017-18 followed 
by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, 
Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in that order. Gujarat 
recorded a fall in its share from the previous year. 
The share of ‘multi-state’ projects has declined in 
the recent period, probably reflecting the bottlenecks 
in obtaining clearances from multiple authorities 
(Chart 3 and Annex Table 7). 
Investment in new projects occupied the 
largest share (89.3 per cent) in the total cost of 
projects sanctioned by banks and FIs. Expansion and 
modernisation constituted 9.2 per cent of the total 
project cost (Annex Table 8). 
The phasing profile of capex of projects sanctioned 
by banks/FIs indicate that around 38 per cent (`650 
billion) of the total proposed expenditure would be 
spent in 2017-18, 24 per cent (`419 billion) in 2018-
19 and 21 per cent (`368 billion) in the year beyond. 
Around 17 per cent of total cost of projects sanctioned 
in 2017-18 was spent during 2014-15 to 2016-17. 
From the planned expenditure, the aggregate 
capex envisaged in 2017-18 showed a marginal 
decrease over the previous year partly due to decrease 
in sanctions by banks/FIs. In 2017-18, capex planned to 
be incurred from resources raised from international 
bond markets declined by 7 per cent from its level a 
year ago. The capital market (equity route) enabled 
financing of envisaged capex of `19 billion in 2017-18, 
which was significantly lower than in the previous 
year.

Private Corporate Investment in 2018-19: Slow Recovery Underway
In sum, it is assessed that a total capex of `1,487 
billion would have been incurred by the private 
corporate sector in 2017-18, of which `802 billion was 
from fresh sanctions during the year. The year marked 
the seventh successive annual contraction in the 
private corporate sector’s capex plans. However, the 
envisaged capex from the pipeline projects3
 already 
undertaken showed an improvement over the previous 
year’s pipeline. On the basis of the pipeline projects 
sanctioned in preceding years, the planned capex 
could amount to `792 billion in 2018-19, marking an 
improvement over the previous year (`685 billion). 
Going forward, the level of corporate investment 
in 2018-19 from the new cohort of projects getting 
sanctioned in 2018-19 will also influence the aggregate 
capex for this year.
In the first half of 2018-19, 190 projects with a 
total cost of `914 billion were sanctioned by banks/FIs. 
A total of 451 investment proposals aggregating `1,158 
billion were sanctioned through the three channels of 
finance (viz. Banks/FIs, ECBs/FCCBs/RDBs and IPOs) 
(Table 1). 
III. Corporate Investment Financed by Private 
Placements and Foreign Direct Investment
In recent years, debt instruments like bonds 
and debentures and foreign direct investment (FDI) 
have assumed prominence as alternative sources 
of capex financing. Mobilisation of funds through 
private placement of debt (bonds and debentures) 
rose substantially during the period from 2013-14 to 
2016-17, but moderated in 2017-18 and H1:2018-19. 
3 Pipeline projects are those projects, which are already undertaken for implementation. Capex from a pipeline projects are envisaged amounts for a given 
year, which got sanctioned prior to the same sanction year.

Similarly, FDI inflows, which witnessed consistent 
increase during the period, dipped marginally in 
2017-18 and H1:2018-19 (Table 2). 
IV. A Time Series Analysis of Envisaged Investment 
Is there a relationship between envisaged capex 
and actual realisations? The one-year ahead forecasts 
of envisaged capex4
 and realised investment in terms 
of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) of the private 
sector in the national account statistics for the period 
1991-92 to 2017-18 exhibit divergence for select 
periods, particularly in some recent years. However, 
there appears to be a co-movement in these two series 
in the longer horizon (Chart 4).
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test 
shows that both the series (envisaged investment and 
realised investment) are stationary in first difference, 
viz. I(1) although, envisaged investment is not 
unambiguously I(1) in view of different results thrown 
up by ADF and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root tests. 
The relationship is examined in an autoregressive 
distributed lag (ARDL) framework which produces 
robust estimates of the long run relationship and 
the error correction process with small samples 
(Pesaran et al, 2001). It also enables determination 
of the precise direction of causation underlying the 
long run relationship. The appropriate ARDL model, 
viz. ARDL (1, 2) was selected on the basis of the akaike 
information criterion (AIC). The coefficients obtained 
from selected ARDL model are statistically significant 
with expected signs. Moreover, error correction model

(ECM) has the expected negative sign on the ECM term, 
with statistically significant short run adjustment 
parameters. The signs on the short run dynamic impact 
are consistent with long run coefficients (Table 3).
The model reveals a long run relationship between 
envisaged investment and realised investment of the 
private corporate sector (Table 4), which is consistent 
with the evidence in literature (Satyanarayana and 
Savalkar, 2003). 
V. Conclusion
The analysis presented in this article points 
to a long term association between envisaged 
capex obtained from project implementation plans 
and realised investment. Thus, these investment 
intentions provide useful insights into the overall 
direction of capex. 
The projects sanctioned in the first half of 
2018-19, together with the pipeline projects already 
undertaken, show some recovery in the capex cycle. 
Going forward, investment activity is expected to 
gather pace, benefitting from the pipeline projects 
lined up by private corporates. 
A revival in the investment cycle could be 
underway in the medium term, as revealed in these 
investment plans. Recent efforts to strengthen 
balance sheets of both corporates and the banking sector
