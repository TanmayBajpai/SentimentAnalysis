, though there has been some
moderation post Infrastructure Leasing & Financial
Services (IL&FS) event. Over time, NBFCs have also
become deeply intertwined with other categories
of financial institutions. Banks are a key source of
credit for NBFCs. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI)
regulations making credit to NBFCs for on-lending
to certain specific sectors, eligible for classification
as priority sector lending have also incentivised the
flow of credit from banks to NBFCs. The reliance of
NBFCs on market-based instruments, like corporate
bonds and commercial paper (CPs), to meet their
financing needs has also grown and stands at about
31 per cent of their total liabilities at end-December
20193
. Mutual funds, especially debt funds, are one of
the major investors in market instruments issued by
NBFCs: mutual funds account for 61 per cent of total
outstanding commercial papers issued by NBFCs as at
end-March, 20204
.
Post IL&FS, however, market financing conditions
for NBFCs became challenging. Action in terms of
rating downgrades, intensive investor scrutiny and
enhanced regulatory oversight were instrumental
in bringing about greater market discipline, with
the better rated and better performing companies
continuing to have relatively easy access to market
financing, while those with asset-liability mismatch
(ALM) issues and/or asset quality concerns were
subjected to higher borrowing costs (Financial
Stability Report, RBI, June 2019). This period also saw
an increase in offshore borrowing due to difficulties
in raising funds domestically. These financing
conditions got further affected in the wake of the
collapse of a large housing finance company during
2019. In more recent times, the disruptions caused
Market financing conditions for non-banking
financial companies (NBFCs), have become more
challenging in recent times, due to COVID-19 related
disruptions, and developments in the mutual fund sector,
in an environment of heightened risk aversion and
differentiation between entities, based on their perceived
risk profile. Further policy interventions may be needed
to ensure flow of funds to credit-worthy NBFCs,
especially small and medium-sized ones and to minimise
systemic risks.
Introduction
Non-banking financial companies play an
important role in promoting inclusive growth in the
country, by catering to the diverse financial needs of
customers not having access to bank finance. NBFCs
in India appear to be substituting for direct lending by
banks in the non-urban parts of the Indian economy
(Acharya et al., 2013). In recent years, NBFCs have
also been a significant source of credit to the micro,
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector,
which accounts for about 29 per cent of India’s
GDP1
. Further, specialised NBFCs have also played
an important role in infrastructure development by
providing long term financing to this sector.
The significance of NBFCs in the Indian financial
landscape has increased during the past years, with
their combined assets expanding from `14.5 lakh
crore as at end March-2014 to above `32 lakh crore

Market Financing Conditions for NBFCs:
Issues and Policy Options
by COVID-19 outbreak have led to apprehensions
that credit profiles of NBFCs could deteriorate, given
the moratorium extended by NBFCs on their assets,
as well as the overall environment of heightened
risk aversion. Recent developments in the mutual
fund industry, which is one of the major source of
funding for NBFCs, have also led to apprehensions
that NBFCs may face rollover risks.
In this milieu, this article examines the impact of
recent events on the financing conditions of NBFCs.
It attempts to assess their impact on the ability of
NBFCs to continue to raise funds from the markets
to meet their repayment obligations and other
funding needs. The analysis is restricted to NBFCs’
market liabilities and does not factor in the impact
(amelioratory or otherwise) of their bank borrowings,
given that bank credit to NBFCs increased by a robust
29 per cent during 2018-19 and by 26 per cent during
2019-205
. Section II discusses developments in
market-based borrowing by the top 100 NBFCs in
terms of asset size. Sections III and IV examine the
changes in financing conditions in the corporate
bond and CP markets, respectively. The impact of
recent measures by the RBI to channel liquidity to
this sector is set out in Section V. Section VI concludes
the study.
II. Developments in Market Borrowing by Top 100
NBFCs
As on April 30, 2020, outstanding market
borrowings for top 100 NBFCs, through CPs and bonds
(both onshore and offshore), stood at around `12.6
lakh crore, marginally higher than `12.5 lakh crore
a year before. Monthly market borrowings, during
the past one year, remained in the range of `60,000
crore to `1,00,000 crore. In April 2020, however,
such borrowings fell to less than `33,000 crore
(Chart 1). There were increased offshore borrowing
too, especially in the last quarter of FY 2019-20.
Consequently, over the last one year, the share of
foreign currency bonds issued by NBFCs in their total
outstanding market liabilities has increased even as
the share of CPs has reduced (Chart 2). The share
of outstanding corporate bonds remained largely
unchanged. 5 As per data on sectoral deployment of banks credit released by RBI.

Market Financing Conditions for NBFCs:
Issues and Policy Options
An analysis of the maturity pattern of outstanding
market liabilities of NBFCs shows that, on April
30, 2020, ` 1.08 lakh crore (or close to 9 per cent of
total outstanding market borrowings) is expected to
mature within the next three months, while another
` 1.6 lakh crore (or 13.4 per cent of total outstanding
market borrowings) will become due for repayment
in the following nine months (Chart 3). Some NBFCs
could face challenges in rolling over / nancing the
redemption requirements at competitive rates, given
the current nancing conditions for the sector as set
out in Section III and IV, and the overall economic
environment. To a certain extent, regulatory/
liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank, increased
nancing by banks and recent decisions by some
banks to extend moratorium to borrowings by NBFCs
may alleviate these challenges.
III. Corporate Bonds and NCDs
Corporate bonds and non-convertible debentures
(NCDs) account for 29 percent 6
 of the total liabilities
of NBFCs indicating the crucial role of this market
in providing funding to the sector. The nancing
conditions for NBFCs through the bond market
have been analysed through various metrics, viz.,
share of the sector in overall issuances; spread
over Government securities (G-Secs) for AAA and
lower rated NBFCs; and bond rollover ratio (Table 1
and 2).

Issues and Policy Options
The nancing conditions in the corporate
bond market, which have remained under stress
since the IL&FS event, gradually stabilised in the
period December 2019 to February 2020 aided
by lower interest rates, higher banking system

Long Term Repo Operations (LTRO) by the Reserve
Bank. This is illustrated by the green cells for

External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) directions
by the RBI in January 2019 also facilitated overseas
capital access for NBFCs and helped in diversifying
their funding avenues. However, post the outbreak
of COVID-19, market conditions for NBFCs have shown
signs of deterioration, with a relatively greater impact
on nancing conditions for NBFC-Pvt - their share
in overall corporate bond issuances fell sharply to 5
per cent in April 2020 from 26 per cent in February
2020.
IV. CP Market
Post the developments related to IL&FS, total
outstanding CPs, which stood at ` 6.88 lakh crore as
on July 31, 2018, declined by 39 per cent to ` 4.17
lakh crore as on April 30, 2020 primarily in the case
of NBFC-Pvt. and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs).
Issuances by corporates and All India Financial
Institutions (AIFIs) remained largely unchanged.
Outstanding CPs of NBFC-Pvt. in particular, fell by 71
per cent (from ` 2.22 lakh crore as on July 31, 2018 to

CP issuances of corporates and AIFIs category of
issuers, as a percentage of the total issuance, has been
increasing steadily (Chart 5). However, the share of
NBFC-Pvt. issuances in total issuances has fallen
sharply, especially during February and March 2020.
IV.2 Lower Rated NBFCs
Even as the overall issuances of CPs by NBFCs have
declined in recent months, there has been a sharper
reduction in issuances by lower rated NBFCs, possibly
a manifestation of the increasingly challenging
nancial conditions faced by them (Chart 6).

IV.3Pricing of CP Issuances
In the recent period, the issuance rates for
AAA rated NBFCs have moderated in line with the
softening of policy rates. Yields for lower rated NBFCs
have also softened but not commensurately. Between
January and April 2020, yields on CP issuances by
AAA rated corporates eased, on an average, by 96
basis points while yields for lower rated issuances
softened by only 20 basis points over the same
period. This was accompanied by a sharp increase in
the spread of AA and below rated papers over the
corresponding tenor Treasuy-Bills in the month of
April 2020 (Chart 8).
V. Steps by RBI
Beginning March 2020, the Reserve Bank
undertook Targeted Long Term Repo Operations
(TLTROs) of three years tenor for a total amount of up
to ` 1 lakh crore at a oating rate linked to the policy
repo rate, with a view to easing liquidity constraints
and de-stressing markets for corporate bonds and CPs.
Liquidity availed under the scheme by banks had to
be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds, CPs
and NCDs. Investments under this facility are also
eligible to be classied as held to maturity (HTM) even

Market Financing Conditions for NBFCs:
Issues and Policy Options
in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted
to be included in the HTM portfolio. Furthermore,
their exposures under this facility would not be
reckoned under the large exposure framework.
TLTROs had a salutary impact on the market. In
response to these auctions, there was a signicant
uptick in the corporate bond market and a moderation
in the liquidity pressures faced by various entities
including NBFCs. The weighted average rate of
issuances in the 2-3 years bucket was also lower by
around 150 basis points in April 2020 (Table 3). In
respect of issuances by NBFCs, the weighted average
rate of issuances in the bucket softened by around
85 bps. Around 74 per cent of the total issuance in
April 2020 was in 2-3 years bucket as compared to
around 41 per cent and 24 per cent of issuance being
in the 2-3 years bucket during February and March
2020, respectively (Chart 9).
Corporates (including banks) were the major
category of issuers, followed by NBFCs and HFCs
during March and April 2020. However, like in previous
months, most issuances in March-April 2020 were by
AAA rated entities and public sector undertakings
(Chart 10), indicating that the bulk of the benet of
TLTROs accrued to higher rated entities. In the CP
market, issuances were lower across all categories in
April as issuers appeared to prefer raising longer tenor
bonds and lock-in the lower rates for a longer time to
avoid roll-over risks.
In order to ensure ow of liquidity to small
and mid-sized corporates, including NBFCs and
micro nance institutions (MFIs), the Reserve Bank
decided to conduct TLTRO 2.0 for an aggregate
amount of ` 50,000 crore. The funds availed by banks
under TLTRO 2.0 should be invested in investment
grade bonds, CPs, and NCDs of NBFCs, with at least
50 per cent of the total amount availed going to
small and mid-sized NBFCs and MFIs. However,
the response to these auctions has been less than
encouraging, with the bid to cover ratio for the
rst tranche of TLTRO 2.0 for a notied amount of
` 25,000 crore at 0.5.

Market Financing Conditions for NBFCs:
Issues and Policy Options
VI. Conclusion
Going forward, there are signicant near-term
redemptions arising out of scheduled repayments on
market borrowings through CPs and corporate bonds
by NBFCs. The moratorium extended by NBFCs/HFCs
on their assets, coupled with the overall environment
of risk aversion, could impact the cashows for the
sector. The possibility of liquidity pressures remaining
elevated for some of these NBFCs, especially those
with high dependencies on market borrowing, cannot
be ruled out. To a certain extent, this gap could be
bridged through increased bank borrowing and/or
group support by some NBFCs. However, one of the
major lenders to NBFCs – the mutual fund industry –
is also facing challenges due to the uncertain economic
outlook and the impact of closure of a few debt funds.
In this context, the possibility of the NBFC sector, at
least some of the NBFCs, facing headwinds in meeting
their funding requirements through market borrowing
cannot be ruled out.
Measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank have
considerably eased the stress in market conditions;
however, stress is still visible in certain areas of the
market. This appears to suggest that the problem is
not just of liquidity but, possibly, of expectations of
deterioration in credit quality on account of COVID-19
related disruptions.
The emerging developments indicate a need
for policy interventions, which go beyond liquidity
related measures to credit related ones. There is a
need for ensuring ow of credit/liquidity to NBFCs
with concrete credit backstop measures to address the
risk aversion in the system, bridge the trust decit
and restore condence.
At the time of this article going to press,
Government of India, as part of an economic stimulus
package, has announced full and partial guarantees
on investments in debt securities issued by NBFCs
under two different schemes. The rst scheme is a
` 30,000 crore special liquidity facility for NBFCs and
HFCs, under which a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
would acquire investment grade debt of short duration
(residual maturity of upto 3 months) of eligible
NBFCs / HFCs. Through another scheme, which is an
extension of already existing Partial Credit Guarantee
Scheme (PCGS), Government would guarantee up
to 20 percent of rst loss for purchase by public
