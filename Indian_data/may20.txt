the period and its frequency was made annual since
1990. At present, all scheduled commercial banks
(SCBs), including regional rural banks (RRBs), report
under BSR-4 which, in effect, is a census.
This article, which addresses the years 2016-17
and 2017-18 as its reference period2

, is confronted by a
large shock to the monetary and financial system with
spillovers to the real economy. On November 8, 2016
currency notes of `500 and `1000 denominations
accounting for 86.9 per cent (RBI, 2017) of the total
notes in circulation were abruptly withdrawn and
ceased to be legal tender. As people herded at eligible
avenues of surrender, a wall of liquidity moved
through the financial system. As this article goes on
to show, current and saving deposits flooded into
the banking system and, although the stock of term
deposits declined marginally in terms of its share in
total deposits, there was a sharp depletion in their
share in incremental deposits. The Reserve Bank’s
liquidity management operations and financial prices
were impacted. Payment habits underwent a shift in
favour of digital modes. Moreover, alterations in saving
behaviour have been reported: as per preliminary
estimates, net financial assets of the household
sector increased in the form of currency, despite an
increase in their liabilities (RBI, 2018). Over 2017-18,
the RBI engaged in a war-time effort to remonetise the
economy by stepping up printing and distribution of
currency notes and by introducing the denomination
of `2000. By March 2018, remonetisation was complete
and although the stock of currency in circulation was
restored to its pre-demonetisation level, the patterns
underlying bank deposits were lagged and incomplete
in their return to normalcy.
Against this backdrop, the main motivation driving
this article is to study the impact of demonetisation and

the subsequent rapid remonetisation on the patterns
of deposit mobilisation by banks by examining the
composition and ownership of bank deposits over the
reference years. In doing so, implications for financial
inclusion are also addressed. The article also captures
the behaviour of foreign currency non-resident
(FCNR) deposits in the context of the unwinding of
special FCNR(B) swaps with the Reserve Bank during
September-November 2016 and the gradual reversion
of these deposits to normalcy over 2017-18.
The rest of the article is organised into three
sections. Section II discusses the stylised facts about the
composition and institutional ownership of deposits.
Section III presents the results of a hierarchical cluster
analysis, which examines the variability in deposits
among states/UTs during the period of study. Section
IV summarises the major findings and concludes the
article.
II. The Stylised Evidence
Bank deposits generally tend to co-move with economic
activity. Since 2010-11, this association appears to
have become closer, pointing to the role of branch
expansion and financial inclusion in formalising
savings into the banking system (Chart 1). In 2016-17,

however, a distinct deviation from this co-movement
was observed, when an overwhelming share (66.2 per
cent) of incremental deposits took the form of savings
deposits in sharp contrast to the average share of 27.5
per cent during the 15-year period 2001-2016 (Chart 2).
Correspondingly, term deposits accounted for
less than 20 per cent of incremental deposits as
against an average share of around 63 per cent during
2001-16. During 2017-18, the growth of savings
deposits remained robust, indicating a degree of
hysteresis in depositors’ preferences.
Notwithstanding the demonetisation-driven
jump, aggregate deposit growth moderated during
2016-18 in relation to the pre-demonetisation years.
This counter-intuitive development needs to be
viewed in the context of two factors which were
simultaneously at work. Firstly, in the financial sector

of the economy, there was a sharp reduction in inter-
bank deposits, reflecting efficient cash management

by banks aided by rapid strides in the real-time
funds transfer technology commencing from 2013-
14. Secondly, in the foreign sector, the redemption of
FCNR(B) swaps – contracted in the defence against the
taper tantrum – produced a contraction in non-resident

deposits in the second half of 2016-17, which began
to get recouped in 2017-18 (Table 1). Consequently,
the share of the financial sector in deposits of SCBs
declined from 10.0 per cent in March 2013 to 5.9 per
cent in March 2018.
An acceleration in deposit growth occurred
across states/Union Territories (UTs) during
2016-17, which moderated in 2017-18. Among
the major contributors of incremental deposits,
Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat improved their
rankings in 2016-17 and states like Bihar, Haryana
and Rajasthan joined the top 10 club, although Bihar

and Rajasthan could not sustain their positions
in 2017-18. Most of the north-eastern states also
recorded high deposit growth during this period. In
terms of incremental deposits from households,
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Punjab improved their ranks
within the top 10 club in 2016-17 but Gujarat and
Punjab slipped out of the club in the following year
(Tables A1.1 and A1.2).
The household3

sector has accounted for 60 per
cent of deposits with the Indian banking system in
recent years (Chart 3). The share of the household
sector increased significantly during 2016-17 and
stayed at the same level up to March 2018, although
the growth of its deposits moderated in 2017-18 from
the demonetisation-induced growth. The household
sector typically holds more than half of its deposits in
term deposits and over one-third in savings deposits.
However, deposit of specified bank notes (SBNs) in
their savings bank accounts generated a sudden jump

in their share of savings deposits in 2016-17 and 2017-
18. At 41.7 per cent, the share of savings deposits in
the total deposits of households reached a new high in
March 2018 (Table 2). The share of individuals within
the household sector jumped to a new high on March
2017 before reducing marginally by March 2018.
During 2016-17, incremental deposits were
driven up by individuals (82 per cent), followed by
Government entities (27 per cent); in the latter, central
and State Governments had a combined share of 17
per cent (Chart 4).
The overall behaviour of households’ bank
deposits in the recent period has also been affected by
schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana

(PMJDY), the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana
(PMSBY), the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
(PMJJBY) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). Bank
deposits have remained the preferred instrument of
household savings in financial assets, followed by
provident and pension funds, and life insurance fund
(Table A2). In 2017-18, however, there was a marked
shift, with currency holdings becoming the preferred
avenue for household saving. While this reflected the
remonetisation that was underway, it suggests that
households still prefer cash for transactional needs
in spite of the after-effects of demonetisation and the
follow-on remonetisation.
Growth in households’ deposits was generally the
lowest for rural branches across population groups till
2010-11 but became faster than urban/ metropolitan
areas during 2011-16 (Table 3). In 2016-17, the growth

pattern shifted in favour of metropolitan and semi-
urban centres, followed by an across the board

moderation in the following year.
Aided by their wide network of branches, public
sector banks (PSBs) retained around three-fourth of
households’ deposits (Table A3). Private sector banks,
which are the second largest bank group, mobilised
more deposits than PSBs during 2017-18. During

demonetisation, private sector banks increased their
share in the deposits of governments, households
and the financial sector. Public sector banks held over
80 per cent of the Government sector deposits, but
a portion of Government sector deposits moved to
private sector banks in 2016-18 (Chart 5). The growth
of bank deposits from non-financial private corporate
sector slackened: incremental deposits stood at `622
billion and `543 billion, respectively, much lower than
`1,011 billion and `1,580 billion, respectively, in the
preceding two years.

Metropolitan areas account for more than half
of total deposits (Chart 6). Their share increased post
demonetisation in March 2017, in spite of the large
redemption of FCNR(B) deposits, which are mainly
held by them.

With increased emphasis on opening of branches
in underbanked/ unbanked areas, including rural
areas, hitherto untapped savings were mobilised
through bank deposits. Consequently, deposit growth
across population groups has witnessed convergence
(Chart 7).

III. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
In this section, we analyse the variability in cash
habits among geographical areas using hierarchical
cluster analysis (HCA) in order to identify shift in
patterns of deposits brought about by demonetisation
which had resulted in a massive transfer of currency
from the public to banks, with a significant portion
not withdrawn immediately.
HCA is a step-wise process in which at each
step, two (out of n) objects/ clusters with the closest
similarity based on a selected criterion are clustered
into one (Everitt, et al., 2011; Hennig, et al., 2015).
Eventually a hierarchy is built up from individual
elements by progressively merging clusters. Among the

several criteria identified to measure similarities/ dis-
similarities between groups of clusters, the centroid

method4
, which is considered robust, is used here. The
result of HCA is a binary tree or dendrogram with n-1
nodes in which branches are cut at a level when the
jump in levels of two consecutive nodes is large. The

HCA is employed for state-wise deposits (in ` million
per 100 population) for three periods i.e., end-March
2016 (before demonetisation), end-March 2017 and
end-March 2018 (after demonetisation). Incremental
deposits per 100 population during 2015-16, 2016-17
and 2017-18 have also been used as a robustness check
to validate the results. States are grouped into five

hierarchical clusters using the centroid method. BSR-
4 data have been used for deposits and annual state-
wise population has been estimated by extrapolating

from the population census of India 2011 by applying
annual growth rates in population between the 2001
and 2011 rounds of the census. The resultant clusters
are sorted in descending order, with cluster-1 having
the highest range of deposits and the lowest range is
in cluster-5. Transition of a state/UT from one cluster
to another shows major improvement / decline.
Demonetisation brought about major
improvement in per capita deposits of households of
seven states/UTs namely Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra and
Nagar Haveli, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab
and Uttarakhand (Table A4). This could not, however,
be sustained in the following year. Incremental

4 In the centroid method, the distance between two clusters is defined as
the (squared) Euclidean distance between their centroids or means. The
centroid method was originated by Sokal and Michener (1958).

per capita deposits of households improved for
Sikkim and Telangana after demonetisation. The UT
of Chandigarh jumped from the lowest cluster to
cluster-2 due to high per capita incremental deposit
mobilisation during demonetisation; however, it
fell back to cluster-4 post-demonetisation. National
Capital Territory of Delhi moved to cluster-3 in the
post-demonetisation phase from the highest cluster
earlier. Maharashtra’s position fell during 2016-17 due
to unwinding of FCNR(B) swap deposits but reverted
thereafter.
The majority of States/UTs were in cluster-5 in
terms of per capita total outstanding deposits during
the years of study (Table A5). In terms of per capita
household sector deposits, Chandigarh, NCT of Delhi
and Goa remained stable, occupying the top two
clusters. There was a gradual decline in the number of
States/UTs in the lowest cluster of household deposits.
To sum up, the results of the HCA indicate
• a notable reduction in the intensity of cash
transactions occurred in 9 out of 36 states/
UTs on account of demonetisation;
• this turned out to be transient, however,
as these states/UTs reverted to cash as

the preferred mode of transaction post-
demonetisation;

• in states like Maharashtra, there were no
perceptible differences in cash habits pre- and
post-demonetisation, with the redemption of
FCNR(B) swap producing a decline in deposits
unrelated to demonetisation.
IV. Conclusion
Shifts in ownership and tenor of deposits
provide valuable insights into payment habits, saving
propensities and liquidity preferences. This article has
the vantage position of studying these patterns under

the impact of a shock – in this case, demonetisation
– and its backwash. This event appears to have
produced a permanent shift in deposit behaviour
with households’ preference shifting to savings
deposits and away from term deposits. This suggests
a premium on liquidity induced by the shock, partly
incentivised by lower rates of returns on term deposits
and alternative avenues of saving which combine the
benefits of liquidity and returns. While the withdrawal
of SBNs caused a shift in payment habits away from
cash, this has proven to be short-lived and mean
reversion became evident in 2017-18 itself. Only two
states show a break from the central tendency, with a
decline in cash dependency.
The results presented in this article draw from
a census. They point to the fact that deposit and
payment habits are inflexible across most states/ UTs
in India and tend to return to steady state, even after
large shocks. This has implications for banks’ deposit
mobilisation strategies and business models.
